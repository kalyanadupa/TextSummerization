5 Abstract
6 Testicular Germ Cell Tumors (TGCT) and patient-derived cell lines are extremely sensitive to cisplatin and other interstrand cross-link (ICL) inducing agents. Nevertheless, a subset of TGCTs are either innately resistant or acquire resistance to cisplatin during treatment. Understanding the mechanisms underlying TGCT sensitivity/resistance to cisplatin as well as the identification of novel strategies to target cisplatin-resistant TGCTs have major clinical implications. Herein, we have examined the proficiency of five embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines to repair cisplatin-induced ICLs. Using γH2AX staining as a marker of double strand break formation, we found that EC cell lines were either incapable of or had a reduced ability to repair ICL-induced damage. The defect correlated with reduced Homologous Recombination (HR) repair, as demonstrated by the reduction of RAD51 foci formation and by direct evaluation of HR efficiency using a GFP-reporter substrate. HR-defective tumors cells are known to be sensitive to the treatment with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. In line with this observation, we found that EC cell lines were also sensitive to PARP inhibitor monotherapy. The magnitude of sensitivity correlated with HR-repair reduced proficiency and with the expression levels and activity of PARP1 protein. In addition, we found that PARP inhibition strongly enhanced the response of the most resistant EC cells to cisplatin, by reducing their ability to overcome the damage. These results point to a reduced proficiency of HR repair as a source of sensitivity of ECs to ICL-inducing agents and PARP inhibitor monotherapy, and suggest that pharmacological inhibition of PARP can be exploited to target the stem cell component of the TGCTs (namely ECs) and to enhance the sensitivity of cisplatin-resistant TGCTs to standard treatments.

8 Introduction
9 Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) develop from pre-malignant intratubular germ cell neoplasia and are histologically distinguished in seminomas and nonseminomas. The latter include yolk sac tumors and choriocarcinomas that represent extraembryonic cell differentiation, teratomas that represent somatic cell differentiation, and embryonal carcinomas (ECs) [1]. ECs are the malignant counterparts to embryonic stem cells and are considered the pluripotent stem cell component of nonseminomatous TGCTs [2]. As such, they are postulated to be the precursor of the other nonseminomatous histological entities.
10 TGCTs are highly curable with approximately 95% of newly diagnosed patients in 2012 expected to be rendered long-term disease-free. This includes more than 70% of patients with advanced (metastatic) disease, distinguishing TGCTs from most other solid tumors. Underlying this unique curability is the exquisite sensitivity of TGCTs to cisplatin-based chemotherapy [3], [4]. However, a subset of TGCTs are either innately resistant (rare) or acquire resistance to cisplatin-based therapy (more common) during cisplatin treatment. Although high-dose chemotherapy and surgery can overcome cisplatin-resistance in some cases, the majority of patients with platinum-resistant TGCT will ultimately die of disease. Tumor recurrence is also a major concern in TGCT patients, and it usually occurs within 2 years after initial treatment. Multiple studies have identified the presence of vascular invasion and the concomitant presence of EC-dominant tumors, as additive-risk factors for tumor recurrence in stage 1 non-seminoma TGCTs [5], [6]. This is likely, because the invading element is commonly, the EC component [7]. Therefore, the development of new therapeutic strategies to target ECs, and platinum-resistant TGCTs represents a clinical priority.
11 The underlying biological mechanism(s) responsible for the cisplatin sensitivity/resistance of TGCTs remains unknown. Several reports indicate that one mechanism for the unique sensitivity of TGCTs to DNA damaging agents is their exceptional apoptotic response [8]. Another attractive hypothesis is that TGCTs display a reduced capacity to repair cisplatin-induced DNA damage [1], [9], [10].
12 Cisplatin causes multiple types of DNA damage, such as mono-adducts, intrastrand crosslinks, DNA-protein crosslinks and interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Despite comprising only a small fraction of cisplatin-induced DNA damage, ICLs are considered the most cytotoxic and genotoxic lesions caused by the drug. Indeed, ICLs covalently link the two strands of the double helix, causing a block of transcription and DNA replication [11]. DNA repair mechanisms play a pivotal role in cellular tolerance to cisplatin by bypassing or removing ICLs. The latter requires several classes of proteins including the nucleotide excision repair (NER) proteins XPF-ERCC1, translesion DNA-polymerases, Fanconi anemia gene products [12], [13], [14], and homologous recombination repair (HR) factors [15]. Double strand breaks (DSBs) near the ICL-site were observed as a pivotal intermediate in ICL repair and their formation only occurred after passage through S-phase [16]. Indeed, the prevailing model for ICL-repair suggests that following collision of the DNA replication fork with an ICL lesion, removal of the adduct is initiated by an incision (DSB formation) in the region surrounding the adduct. Unhooking of the ICL-adduct by XPF-ERCC1 proteins, DNA synthesis (directed by translesion DNA polymerases), and re-establishment of the replication fork integrity by HR, then completes repair of the DNA lesion [15], [17].
13 Analysis of NER protein expression in TGCT-derived cell lines revealed that levels of XPA, ERCC1 and XPF DNA repair proteins are reduced with respect to somatic tumors cells, suggesting that impaired NER function might account for TGCT sensitivity to ICL-inducing agents [9]. However, overexpression of ERCC1 and XPF in TGCT cell lines elicits only a small increase in their ICL-repair proficiency and resistance to cisplatin [10]. Therefore, while NER proteins appear to have a protective role, their deficiency does not fully explain the unique sensitivity of TGCTs to cisplatin and suggests that additional defects in ICL repair might be of critical significance.
14 Homologous recombination (HR) is an attractive candidate based on its importance for ICL repair; HR is frequently dysregulated in a variety of tymor types and HR deficiency is involved in the susceptibility of cancer cells to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. The cytotoxicity of PARP inhibitors has been postulated to result from an increased number of double strand breaks in cells that can poorly repair them [18], [19] and/or from dysregulation of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway [20].
15 In this report, we show that the cisplatin-sensitivity of ECs is due to their inability to repair ICL-induced damage. Moreover, we demonstrate that in addition to defective ERCC1/XPF-dependent repair mechanisms, the sensitivity of TGCTs to ICL-inducing agents relies on their reduced proficiency in HR. Extending these findings, we tested the sensitivity of five EC cell lines (with varying degrees of cisplatin-sensitivity) to the PARP inhibitor AZD2281, either alone or in combination with cisplatin. Our results indicate that all EC cell lines are sensitive to AZD2281 monotherapy at clinically relevant concentrations and that inhibition of PARP activity significantly enhances cisplatin cytotoxicity especially in cell lines relatively resistant to the drug. These findings suggest that PARP inhibitors are a potential novel candidates for targeted treatment of ECs and TGCTs otherwise resistant to standard therapies.

18 Embryonal Carcinoma (EC) Cell Lines Exhibit Differential Sensitivities to Cisplatin
19 To determine the sensitivity of EC cell lines to cisplatin, we analyzed their ability to survive drug treatment by colony-forming assays (Fig. 1A). We compared five different cell lines, three of which, 27x-1 [21] NCCIT [22] and NTERA2-D1 (NT2D1) [23], are considered pluripotent, whereas the other two, 2102Ep and Tera-1 [24], [25], are classified as nullipotent (summarized in Table S1). As a control for cisplatin-resistant cells, we used the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS and the non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line MCF10A. EC cell lines were sensitive to cisplatin compared with MCF10A and U2OS but displayed a wide range of response. The IC50 varied from 2.49±0.4 µM for the less sensitive cell line (27x-1) to 0.4±0.03 µM for the most sensitive cell line (NT2D1) (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that, although they appear more sensitive to cisplatin than somatic tumor (and non-tumor) cells, EC cell lines differ from each other, suggesting that resistant cells may have acquired specific molecular characteristics that render them less responsive to treatment.

23 EC Cell Lines are Deficient in ICL-damage Repair
24 The phosphorylation of histone H2AX on serine 139 (γH2AX) is considered a general marker of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by several chemotherapeutic drugs, including cisplatin [26]. To analyze whether cisplatin-sensitivity of EC cell lines relies on reduced ability to repair DNA damage, we used Flow cytometry (FACS) analysis to monitor over time, the percent of cells that are γH2AX-positive, following a pulse-exposure to cisplatin (Fig. 1B). Unsynchronized U2OS and EC cells were treated for 6 hours (hs) with 3.3 µM cisplatin (a median plasma concentration measured in TGCT cisplatin-treated patients [27]) and collected at 12 h, 24 h and 72 hs after the start of cisplatin exposure. Cisplatin caused a cell cycle delay in S-phase in all cell lines, followed (in EC cells) by increased accumulation of cells in S or G2/M at the expense of cells in G1 (Fig. 1 D–G, and Fig. S1 A–H). In most cases, the initial cell cycle delay was accompanied by an increase of γH2AX signal in S-phase (Fig. 1 H–I, Fig. S1 I–L, Fig. S2); likely due to formation of DSBs at the collapsed replication-fork [15], [16]. However, while in the somatic tumor cell line U2OS γH2AX signal quickly decreased and returned nearly to control level by 72 hs, even in relatively cisplatin resistant EC cell lines (27x-1, 2102Ep, Tera-1), γH2AX reduction was much less efficient (Fig. 1B and H, and Fig. S1 I–K). Importantly, the different response of 27x-1, 2102Ep, Tera-1 and U2OS to damage was not attributable to differences in cell death, as the sub-G1 population was not markedly increased (Fig. 1C), indicating that these cell lines truly vary in their proficiency to repair ICLs. Furthermore, the most cisplatin-sensitive cell lines NCCIT and NT2D1 were even more defective in ICL repair such that the γH2AX signal increased over time after treatment (Fig. 1B and I and Fig. S1L), and a significant fraction of sub-G1 population arose (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that in EC cell lines, cisplatin sensitivity correlates with cellular proficiency to repair the ICL damage. Importantly, in all cell lines, the initial cisplatin-induced DNA damage (Fig. 1B, t = 6 h) was similar, suggesting that under our experimental conditions, cell lines are not significantly different from each other in drug uptake, efflux or detoxification [28].
25 Reduced Proficiency of ECs to Repair ICL-induced Damage is Mechanistically Distinct from their Apoptotic Elimination
26 It has been recently proposed that the inability of the NT2D1 cell line to repair cisplatin-induced damage is due to rapid and massive induction of apoptosis that precedes the onset of DNA damage-repair [8]. To evaluate whether in our experimental conditions apoptosis prevents damage repair and test whether increased γH2AX staining is due to DSB formation, rather than an the early apoptotic response, we analyzed cisplatin-induced γH2AX profile in the presence of the caspase-inhibitor, N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(O-Me)-fluoromethyl-ketone (z-VAD-FMK). Unsynchronized cells were treated for 2 h with 50 µM caspase inhibitor followed by a pulse of 3.3 µM cisplatin for 6 h. After incubation, cisplatin was removed, and cells were cultured in the presence of z-VAD-FMK for up to 72 h after the start of cisplatin exposure. Under these conditions, cell death of NT2D1 was markedly reduced (compare Fig. 1C and Fig. 2A). However, the γH2AX signal did not decrease over time (Fig. 2B), indicating that EC cells have an intrinsic inability to repair ICL damage, which is mechanistically distinct from their apoptotic response. Notably, under the conditions described above, the cell cycle profiles were similar in all cell lines (data not shown). Thus the different kinetic of repair is not linked to different timing of cell cycle arrest.

28 Figure 2
29 The inability of NT2D1 cell line to repair ICL-induced DSBs, is not rescued by preventing their apoptotic response.
30 Reduced Expression of NER-repair Factors does not Fully Account for the Differential Sensitivity of EC Cells to Cisplatin
31 The reduced expression of NER-proteins XPF and ERCC1 has been proposed to explain TGCT sensitivity to DNA damaging agents [9], [10]. To examine this hypothesis, we analyzed our panel of EC cells for expression of XPF/ERCC1 proteins. As controls, we used three human fibroblast cell lines, one with significantly reduced expression of ERCC1 (165TOR) [29], one lacking XPF (XP2YO) [30] and a XP2YO cell line complemented with XPF (XP-F) [31]. Similar to a previous report [9], TGCT cell lines had somewhat reduced ERCC1 expression compared to U2OS (Fig. 3A and C); however, XPF protein levels were not obviously reduced in most cell lines (Fig. 3B and D). Because XPF and ERCC1 act as heterodimer, reduced expression in ERCC1 might drive the reduction in ICL-repair proficiency, promoting sensitivity of ECs to cisplatin. However, within EC cell lines, we did not observe a correlation between cisplatin resistance and ERCC1 expression levels. Since resolution of ICL damage requires the coordinated action of multiple repair mechanisms [17], this result suggests that the differential cisplatin-sensitivity of EC cells may depend on dysregulation of DNA repair mechanisms other than XPF-ERCC1.

33 Figure 3
34 The high sensitivity of EC cell lines to cisplatin correlates with a reduced expression of ERCC1 but not XPF.
35 EC Cell Lines Display a Reduced Proficiency in HR
36 HR is a major pathway for repair of DNA ICLs in mammalian cells [15]. It functions in S/G2 phases in the same process with XPF/ERCC1, even though the latter are not required to initiate HR [17], [32]. At the cellular level, early steps of HR repair can be visualized (in both replicating and damaged cells) by the formation of RAD51 foci [33]. Since HR repair occurs during genome replication, we tested whether the sensitivity of EC cell lines to cisplatin was due to defective HR-repair by quantifying the number of RAD51 foci in S-phase. Cell lines were treated with 3.3 µM cisplatin for 6 h and co-stained with both anti-RAD51 and anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4A and quantified in Fig. 4C, the number of RAD51 foci per cell was significantly lower in 2102Ep, Tera-1 and NT2D1 than in U2OS, indicating a defect in HR. In addition, sensitivity to cisplatin correlated with the level of S phase RAD51 foci; such that the most cisplatin-sensitive cell line, NT2D1, was the most defective in RAD51 foci assembly. Importantly, the observed reduction of RAD51 foci was not attributable to a difference in cisplatin-induced damage as documented by the similar number of γH2AX foci formed across cell lines (Fig. 4B, 4D and Fig. 1B [t = 6 hs]). The only exception was 27x-1, in which RAD51 foci numbers were not reduced with respect to U2OS. To test whether the HR-repair proficiency of 27x-1 was comparable to that of U2OS, we performed a functional HR-assay, measuring their ability to repair DSBs introduced by I-SceI in a GFP-recombination substrate (DR-GFP)[34]. In this assay, repair of DSB by HR results in reconstitution of a functional GFP gene such that HR-proficiency can be quantified by FACS analysis [35] (Fig.S3A). As a control, the assay was also performed in a cell line (Tera-1) in which cisplatin-induced RAD51 focus assembly was low. Consistent with their relative sensitivities to cisplatin, both 27x-1 and Tera-1 were two-fold less proficient in this assay than U2OS cells (Fig. 4E, black bars, and S3B). Transfection efficiencies are similar for all three cell lines (Fig. 4E, white bars). These data demonstrate that EC cell lines have a reduced proficiency in HR.
37 Figure 4
38 Figure 4
39 ECs are defective in HR repair.
40 To understand whether the defect in the assembly of RAD51 foci observed in most EC cell lines was the consequence of reduced expression of the protein, we performed a western blot analysis. RAD51 was similarly expressed in U2OS as in EC cell lines (Fig. 5A top panel, and Fig. 5B), indicating that a functional deficiency in formation of RAD51 foci rather than differential expression of this protein may cause an the HR defect. It has recently been suggested that deficiency in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene causes a functional defect in RAD51 foci assembly [36]. Because PTEN expression was reported to be virtually absent in 86% of ECs [37], we analyzed protein expression in our EC cell lines. As shown in Fig. 5A (mid panel) and quantified in Fig. 5C, PTEN was expressed in all cell lines except NCCIT, indicating that, as also suggested in another tumor model [38], reduced PTEN expression was not the primary cause of the defective RAD51 function.
41 Figure 5
42 Figure 5
43 The reduced expression of RAD51, PTEN or BRCA1, does not account for the reduced proficiency of EC cell lines, in HR-repair.
44 The breast cancer tumor susceptibility gene product BRCA1 has a fundamental role in HR [39], promoting proper RAD51 focus formation, including HR in ICL repair [14],[40]. Therefore, we analyzed BRCA1 protein expression in EC cell lines as compared to HR-proficient U2OS. As shown in Fig. 5D–E, BRCA1 expression was reduced, with respect to U2OS, in Tera-1 and NT2D1 cell lines, but not in 27x-1 and 2102Ep, and not significantly in NCCIT. Thus, although BRCA1 down-regulation might contribute to the increased cisplatin-sensitivity of Tera-1 and NT2D1, it does not appear to fully explain the differential response to cisplatin among EC cell lines.
45 ECs are Sensitive to Treatment with the Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor AZD2281
46 Preclinical studies have demonstrated that cancer cells with defective HR repair caused by either BRCA1 or BRCA2 inactivating mutations, display exquisite sensitivity to PARP inhibitors [41], [42]. AZD2281 (olaparib; KU-0059436) is an orally active PARP inhibitor, which proved to be active and well-tolerated in preclinical mouse models [43] and in clinical trials with patients [44]. Since HR-reduced proficiency appears to be a common feature among EC cell lines, we analyzed their response to AZD2281. Recent evidence indicates that the treatment of U2OS with the PARP inhibitor PHEN down-regulates BRCA1/RAD51 expression causing a defect in HR [45]. By colony assay, we found that U2OS are also sensitive to AZD2281 (not shown), thus this cell line could not be used as resistant control cell line for this drug. To overcome this problem we compared the sensitivity of EC cell lines to AZD2281 to that of the relatively PARP inhibitor-resistant (and HR proficient) MCF10A [46], [47]. As shown in Fig. 6A, ECs were sensitive to AZD2281 treatment, and PARP inhibitor sensitivity generally correlated with sensitivity to cisplatin (compare Figures 1A and ​and6A).6A). An exception was Tera-1, which was moderately resistant to cisplatin but extremely sensitive to AZD2281, suggesting that the mechanism(s) of resistance/sensitivity to platinum agents and PARP inhibitors do not completely overlap. Notably, however, the two most PARP inhibitor sensitive cell lines have very low BRCA1 levels (Fig. 5D).
47 Figure 6
48 Figure 6
49 EC cell lines are sensitive to AZD2281 treatment.
50 To evaluate whether sensitivity of EC cell lines to AZD2281 correlates with their reduced proficiency to repair drug induced-DNA damage, we quantified the percentage of γH2AX positive cells, upon continuous exposure to the IC50 dose of AZD2281. As shown in Fig. 6B, while relatively PARP inhibitor-resistant cell lines (27x-1 and 2102Ep) were able to repair the damage, the most sensitive cell lines (Tera-1, NCCIT and NT2D1) displayed no reduction in γH2AX positive cells. As judged by the fraction sub-G1 cells, apoptosis was evident by 72 hs with the Tera-1 and NT2D1 cell lines (3.58±1.5% and 6.78±2.3%, respectively).
51 To further investigate the mechanism of EC cell sensitivity to PARP inhibition, we analyzed γH2AX levels throughout the cell cycle. In most EC cell lines (but not in MCF10A), AZD2281 treatment, was accompanied by a prominent increase in damage in G2 (Fig. 6G–H and Fig. S4I–L), with delay in the S/G2 phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 6C–F, and S4 A–H), indicating that the sensitization effect required passage through replication, a cell cycle stage when HR is more effective.
52 Sensitivity of ECs to AZD2281 Correlates with PARP1 Protein Expression and Activity
53 PARP is frequently hyper-activated in HR-defective cells, and reversion mutations that rescue HR defects also reduce PARP activity [48]. Therefore, it has been proposed that DNA lesions that accumulate in HR-defective cells require PARP-mediated repair. There are at least 18 PARP family members described so far, however it is recognized that most cellular PARP activity (measured by PAR-polymer formation) is attributable to PARP1 [49]. We asked whether sensitivity of EC cell lines to AZD2281 correlates with PARP1 protein expression and activity. Using an in vitro assay, we measured the maximal PARP activity (induced by the presence of nuclease-treated DNA) and correlated the results with PARP1 protein expression levels. As shown in Fig. 7A, we found that within EC cell line group, PARP activity was higher in the most PARP inhibitor-sensitive cell lines (NCCIT, Tera-1, NT2D1). In addition, in most cell lines, PARP1 expression correlated with PARP inducible activity (Fig. 7B–C), suggesting that EC cell lines that rely more strongly on PARP activity to repair DNA damage (due to a reduced proficiency of HR) have increased PARP1 protein levels and are most likely to respond to PARP inhibitor monotherapy.

57 AZD2281 Enhances the Sensitivity of TGCT Cell Lines to Cisplatin
58 Cisplatin and AZD2281 have been shown to cooperate in the treatment of BRCA-1 deficient mammary tumors in vivo [43], and PARP inhibitors enhance cancer cell sensitivity to radiation and alkylating agents [50]. Since we found ECs have a reduced proficiency in HR repair, we tested their sensitivity to combined therapy, exposing them to a pulse (6 hs) of increasing doses of cisplatin in continuous presence of AZD2281 (given at the half IC50 dose for each cell line). Under these conditions, the number of surviving colonies for the relatively cisplatin-resistant EC cell lines 27x-1 and 2102Ep was similar to that of cisplatin-sensitive NCCIT cells (Fig. 8A). The effect was even stronger for the Tera-1 cell line, whose survival profile paralleled that of NT2D1. This result indicates that AZD2281 enhance the toxicity of cisplatin in EC cells. Importantly the effect of the combined treatment was more marked in relatively cisplatin-resistant EC cells (27x-1, 2102Ep, Tera-1) than in the most cisplatin-sensitive (NCCIT, NT2D1) such that the IC50 value for cisplatin, was reduced of 2–3-fold in NCCIT and NT2D1, and about 10-fold in 27x-1, 2102Ep and Tera-1 (Table 1).

65 To gain further insight about the mechanism of EC-response to the combined treatment we analyzed the ability of cell lines to repair DNA damage using γH2AX as marker. The increased sensitivity of EC cell lines to combined treatment was linked to their inability to repair DNA (Fig. 8B), damage, and DNA-damaged cells arrested at G2 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. S5). As result, the percentage of apoptotic cell death as measured 72 hs after the beginning of treatment was increased with respect to either cisplatin or AZD2281 monotherapy treatments (Fig. 8C), validating the effect of the combined therapy.

67 Discussion
68 Embryonal carcinomas (ECs) are considered the stem cell component of nonseminomatous TGCTs and, as cancer stem cells, maintain self-renewal capacity and are often multipotent. Along with vascular invasion, the concomitant presence of over 50% EC cell type in the primary tumor, is a risk factor for tumor relapse in patients with stage 1 nonseminomatous TGCT [5], [6]; probably because in most cases the invading element is the EC [7]. For these patients, the development of post-operatory (orchiectomy) adjuvant therapy to delay or prevent tumor relapse is needed. In addition despite the high curability rate, in some cases TGCTs become resistance to treatment. Thus, the development of new therapies to overcome resistance is also urgently required.
69 We have studied five EC cell lines, and characterized their sensitivity to cisplatin, demonstrating that these cells are more sensitive to cisplatin compared to the somatic cell lines MCF10A and U2OS. Nevertheless, within EC cell line the sensitivity to cisplatin also varied, with 27x-1, 2102Ep and Tera-1 being more resistant than NCCIT and NT2D1 (Fig. 1A). This observation suggests that ECs can have or acquire molecular characteristic that render them more resistant to treatment, increasing the risk of incomplete response and tumor relapse.
70 Why are EC cells generally more sensitive to DNA damaging agents than somatic tumors and why are some EC cell lines more sensitive to cisplatin than others? Chemosensitivity can be influenced by several factors, including drug transport across the cell membrane, drug detoxification, and accessibility of drug to DNA. We observed that the initial cisplatin-induced DNA damage measured by γH2AX staining (Fig. 1B [t = 6 hs] and Fig. 4D), is not significantly different in EC cell lines compared to the somatic tumor cell line U2OS; indicating that the superior responsiveness of EC cells to cisplatin is not attributable to upstream events that regulate cisplatin damage to DNA.
71 TRP53 is intimately involved in the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and resistance to therapy following DNA damage. This gene is often mutated in somatic tumors but only rarely in TGCTs [51]. This difference has been proposed as one explanation for the unique cisplatin sensitivity of TGCTs. However, the high sensitivity of TRP53-mutated NCCIT cells (Table S1) to cisplatin observed here (Fig. 1A) and in other studies indicates that TRP53 mutation alone does not confer cisplatin-resistance in these cells [51]. In addition, as previously reported in other studies [8], neither high constitutive p53 protein levels nor p53 accumulation/activation upon cisplatin treatment correlated with EC cell lines sensitivity, (Fig. S6) suggesting that EC cells possess unknown intrinsic characteristics that make them unique in their response to DNA damage.
72 Recently, Gutekunst and colleagues proposed that the extreme platinum sensitivity of EC cell lines is due to p53 protein level increases, induced either by DNA damage (cisplatin) or by MDM2-inhibitors (Nutlin-3), resulting in a rapid and massive apoptotic response that prevents DNA repair [8]. However, in our study, prevention of the apoptotic response did not influence the ability of EC cells to repair DNA damage (Fig. 2A–B). These discrepant results could reflect the fact that the methods used by these authors likely preferentially detect intrastrand (which account for over 90% of cisplatin lesions) rather than ICLs. TGCTs have been reported to be proficient in intrastrand cross-link, but not ICL repair [10],[8], supporting this conclusion. In addition, similar to recent findings [52],[44], we found that, in EC cells, Nutlin-3 induces DNA-damage, as measured by γH2AX staining (data not shown). Thus, although we agree that increased levels of p53 cause activation of a rapid and massive apoptotic response in EC cells, we believe that the trigger for this response is the persistence of DNA damage in cells that can poorly repair it. In this context, while the development of TGCTs would be allowed by a partial functional inactivation of p53 (see [53], [54]), such mechanism would be insufficient to counteract the pro-apoptotic function of p53 induced by a persistent damage, causing a rapid cell death. The observation that co-treatment of cells relatively resistant to cisplatin with cisplatin and AZD2281 causes a defect in repair of ICLs (persistent damage) and reduces their ability to form colonies (Fig. 8), supports this conclusion.
73 Which defect in DNA damage repair is most critical to cisplatin sensitivity in EC cells? Usanova observed that the overexpression of ERCC1 and XPF could partially reverse the cisplatin-sensitivity of TGCT cell lines [10], suggesting that a reduced proficiency in ICL-repair, induced by the low expression of these factors, in EC cells might promote cisplatin sensitivity [9]. In the current study, we observed an approximately 50% reduction in ERCC1 (but not XPF) expression as compared to U2OS (Fig. 3). However, since U2OS can be up to 27-fold more resistant than ECs to cisplatin (Fig. 1A), this difference is unlikely to fully account for the platinum-sensitivity of EC cell lines, suggesting that additional mechanisms of ICL-repair might be defective. In addition, among EC cell lines, there was no correlation between levels of ERCC1 expression and cell sensitivity to DNA damage.
74 Because the ability of cycling cells to repair ICLs requires HR [15], [17], we hypothesized that EC cells may be defective in this pathway. Indeed, we observed that 2102Ep, Tera-1 and NT2D1 were defective in RAD51 foci assembly (Fig. 4A and 4C), indicating a defect in HR repair. The EC cell line 27x-1 which is equally sensitive to cisplatin as 2102Ep and Tera-1 (Fig. 1A) was not defective in this assay, but was equally defective as Tera-1 cells in repair of ISce-I induced DSBs (Fig. 4E and Fig. S3B). These results suggest that perhaps 27x-1 cells are defective in a step downstream of RAD51 foci formation, and more in general that ECs are functionally defective in HR-repair, as also suggested by the similar expression of RAD51 in all cell lines (Fig. 5A–B). However, overall the molecular mechanisms behind EC HR-reduced proficiency are still unclear and might be different among cell lines. Their identification will likely require high throughput studies to globally examine the gene expression signature that distinguishes TGCT cells from other solid tumor cells that display lower sensitivity to cisplatin treatment.
75 HR-deficient tumors can be specifically targeted by treatment with PARP inhibitors [18], [19]. Therefore, we investigated whether EC cell lines are responsive to PARP inhibition. As shown in Fig. 6A, EC cells were sensitive to AZD2281 and their response correlated with reduced ability to overcome PARP inhibitor-induced damage (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, in most cases, the response to treatment with AZD2281 correlated with the magnitude of HR defect; such that 27x-1 and 2102Ep, which were relatively proficient in this pathway, were more resistant as compared to grossly defective NT2D1 cells. Because AZD2281-treated cells experience a delay in S/G2 phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 6C–F and S4A–H) and the induced-damage predominantly occurs in G2-phase (Fig. 6G–H and Fig. S4I–L), it is likely that DSB formation requires passage through S-phase; possibly as a consequence of inhibition of the base excision repair pathway by the inhibition of PARP [41]. However, dysregulation of the NHEJ pathway might also play a role [20]. Interestingly, Tera-1 cells, which are relatively resistant to cisplatin, are extremely sensitive to PARP inhibition (Fig. 6A). One possible explanation is that in these cells PARP activity is required to sustain HR function, as previously demonstrated in U2OS and other cell lines [45]. In addition, the observation that PARP-inducible activity is higher in the most PARP inhibitor-sensitive EC cells (Fig. 7A) suggest that in these tumors PARP activation might be required to compensate for the HR defect. Interestingly, PARP1 protein expression correlates with its inducible activity in most EC cells, (Fig. 7B–C) and thus might represent a predictive marker for response to PARP-inhibitors monotherapy in EC cells despite its lack of predictive ability in other tumor models [55]. The observation that EC cells are sensitive to AZD2281 monotherapy might also be of interest in the clinical setting to delay or prevent tumor relapse. In TGCT patients, tumor recurrence varies depending on the risk-group. Vascular invasion and high percentage (>50%) of EC are known predictors of metastases in stage 1 TGCT patients, especially when the two risk factors are present concomitantly (high-risk group) [5], [6]. Because in the latter case, the EC component of the tumor is often the invading element [7], and high percentage/pure EC plus vascular invasion is a common feature, we propose that patients that present both risk factors might be potentially eligible, and take advantage from a (post-orchiectomy) adjuvant chemotherapy treatment, which includes AZD2281. Such treatment, might represent a valid option to reduce or prevent disease relapse.
76 Remarkably, we found that AZD2281 enhances cisplatin cytotoxicity, most dramatically in relatively platinum-resistant EC cell lines (Fig. 8A and Table 1), even at concentrations of AZD2281 below the plasma concentration measured in clinical trials [42]. Such response is due to the reduced ability of the cells to repair overcome the damage (Fig. 8B) and increased apoptotic cell death (Fig. 8C), likely caused by the inability of the cells in S/G2 phase of the cell cycle to process ICL-induced DSB properly (Fig. S5).
77 In conclusion, the findings that EC cells have a reduced proficiency in HR and are sensitive to PARP inhibitor AZD2281 monotherapy suggest that this drug might be of interest for the treatment of patients with high-risk of occult metastasis. In addition, the observation that AZD2281 enhances cisplatin sensitivity in relatively-resistant EC cells, suggests that PARP inhibitors might be used to implement TGCT therapy, especially in patients resistant to standard therapies.

79 Materials and Methods
80 Cell Lines and Culturing
81 U2OS and TGCT cell lines were cultured in DMEM 15% FCS plus antibiotics (Lonza). EC cell lines were provided by R. S. K. Chaganti (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Cell line 2102Ep was also provided by Prof. P. Andrews (Sheffield University, GB). U2OS was obtained from Amerycan Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The primary human fibroblast XP2YO and XPF-complemented (XP-F) cell lines were provided by Dr. L.J. Niedernhofer (Pittsburgh University); while cell line 165TOR was provided by Dr. Jan Hoeijmakers (Erasmus MC). Cell lines were cultured as described [29], [30], [31], [56]. Wild type and Brca1−/− Mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) were cultured as described in [35]. All cell lines were maintained at 37°C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.
82 Clonogenic Cell Survival Assay
83 2×103 to 3×103 cells were seeded in 10 cm plates, and allowed to adhere at for 18 hs before drug treatments. Cisplatin (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and given alone or in combination with AZD2281 for 6 hs. At the end of the incubation drugs were washed out, and cells cultured for 14 days in either drug-free media or in constant presence of AZD2281. AZD2281 (Organic Synthesis Core Facility, MSKCC) was dissolved in DMSO and added fresh into the culture every 2 days. At the end of treatment, cells were fixed in methanol, and stained with Giemsa 20% (Sigma Aldrich) for quantification of the number of colonies.
84 Flow Cytometric (FACS) Quantification of Phospho-H2AX (Ser139)
85 Approximately 500×103 cells either treated or untreated with cisplatin, and/or AZD2281, were collected, fixed in cold 70% ethanol, washed in Tris-buffered saline pH 7.4 (TBS) and rehydrated for 10 min at room temperature in TBS with 4% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 (TST). The primary antibody, anti-phosho-Histone H2AX (Ser139) (Upstate Biotechnology), was diluted 1[ratio]250 in TST, and incubated for 2 hs at room temperature (RT). After two washes with TBS buffer, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody diluted 1[ratio]200 (FITC-conjugated Invitrogen Alexa Four 488) in TST for 1 h at RT. Cells were then rinsed in TBS and resuspended in TBST/50 mg/ml RNase A in presence of 100 mg/ml propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. For cell cycle analysis, a minimum of 10×103 stained cells were acquired on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with the Flowjo software.
86 Immunoblotting
87 Upon trypsinization, cells were washed in PBS, and resuspended in 300 µl NETT lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris base, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing Complete mini-protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Antibody sources and dilutions were as follows: RAD51 H-92 (1[ratio]500), p53 sc-263 (1[ratio]1000), PARP1/2 H-250 (1[ratio]1000) and BRCA1 C-20 (1[ratio]250), Santa Cruz Biotecnology. P21 CP-74 (1[ratio]500), Thermo scientific. XPF ab-76948 (1[ratio]1,000), Abcam. ERCC1 NB-100–117 (1[ratio]1,000). Anti-tubulin DM1A T-9026 (Novus Biologicals) and anti-actin A-5316 (Sigma Aldrich) antibodies were used at 1[ratio]15,000 dilution. Densitometric analysis of immunoblottings were performed by using the ImageQuant 5.1 software (Amersham).
88 RAD51 and γH2AX Foci Assay
89 RAD51 and γH2AX foci were quantified in S-phase staining for BrdU. To do so, cisplatin-untreated or treated cells were exposed to 10 µM BrdU (Sigma Aldrich) 30 minutes before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. After fixation, cells were washed in PBS and incubated with 1 M HCl for 20 minutes. Following a wash with PBS, cells were incubated in 0.1 M sodium borate (PH 8.5) for 2 minutes at RT and washed again with PBS. Permeabilization was performed with PBS 0.5% Triton X-100 plus 0.5% normal goat serum (NGS) at RT for 15 minutes, and followed by blocking with 0.2% NGS in PBS at RT for 1h. The anti-RAD51 (Santa Cruz) γH2AX (Cell Signaling) and anti-BrdU (33281A, Pharmigen) antibodies were used at 1[ratio]250, 1[ratio]1000, and 1[ratio]200 dilutions respectively. Primary antibodies were incubated for 90 minutes at RT. Secondary antibodies (Alexa-488 and Alexa-594, Invitrogen) were used at 1[ratio]1000 dilutions. The total number of foci in BrdU positive and negative cells, were counted manually by using Zeiss observer Z1 microscope. All images were acquired at 100x magnification.
90 DSB Assays
91 DSB repair was measured by using a GFP-based assay for HR as described previously [35] In brief, efficiency of HR was assessed by co-transfecting an I-SceI expression plasmid (pCBASce) with a GFP-reporter substrate (DR-GFP). The assay works through gene conversion repair of a DSB caused by I-SceI digestion; such that the DR-GFP plasmids repaired by HR express GFP (see Fig. S3A). U2OS and EC cells were transiently transfected (Amaxa Biotechnology) with 1 µg of DR-GFP plus 3 µg of I-SceI expressing vector or 1 µg of DR-GFP plus 3 µg of control plasmids (pCAGGS). Transfection efficiency was evaluated by transfecting cells with 1 µg of a GFP-expressing vector (Nze-GFP) plus 3 µg of pCAGGS. The number of GFP-expressing cells and cell cycle profiles were evaluated using the Becton Dickinson FACScan, and analyzed with the Flowjo software.
92 PARP Activity Assay
93 Cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, containing 0.6 mM EDTA, 14 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100 and cocktail of proteases inhibitors (Roche) as previously described [57]. Proteins (25 µg) were incubated with 2 mCi 32PNAD+, 100 mM NAD+, 100 mg/mL H1 histone, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 14 mM β-mercaptoethanol in the presence of 10 µg nuclease-treated salmon testes DNA (Enzo Life Science). After 15 minutes at 30°C the reaction was stopped by addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid 20% (v/v) and the radioactivity associated with the acid-insoluble material, corresponding to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins, was counted on a Beckman LS8100 liquid scintillation counter. PARP activity was expressed as pmol of 32P-NAD+/mg of protein.

196 Abstract
197 Deregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression can lead to cancer initiation and progression. However, limited information exists on the function of miRNAs in cancer maintenance. We examined these issues in the case of myeloproliferative diseases and neoplasms (MPN), a collection of hematopoietic neoplasms regarded as preleukemic, thereby representing early neoplastic states. We report here that microRNA-125a (miR-125a)–induced MPN display a complex manner of oncogene dependence. Following a gain-of-function genomics screen, we overexpressed candidate miR-125a in vivo, which led to phenotypes consistent with an atypical MPN characterized by leukocytosis, monocytosis, splenomegaly, and progressive anemia. The diseased MPN state could be recapitulated in a doxycycline-inducible mouse model. Upon doxycycline withdrawal, the primary MPN phenotypes rapidly resolved after the discontinuation of miR-125a overexpression. However, reinduction of miR-125a led to complex phenotypes, with some animals rapidly developing lethal anemia with extensive damages in the spleen. Forced expression of miR-125a resulted in elevated cellular tyrosine phosphorylation and hypersensitivity toward hematopoietic cytokines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-125a targets multiple protein phosphatases. Our data demonstrate that miR-125a–induced MPN is addicted to its sustained overexpression, and highlight the complex nature of oncogenic miRNA dependence in an early neoplastic state.
198 oncogene addiction PTPN18 spleen fibrosis
199 The expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is frequently deregulated in human cancers (1, 2). Alteration in miRNA gene expression or function can promote cancer initiation and progression in vivo, leading to the recognition that this class of small noncoding RNAs can function as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors (3⇓–5). Much less is known, however, regarding the role of miRNAs in cancer maintenance. A special type of cancer maintenance is related to oncogene dependence/addiction, in which the maintenance of cancer phenotype is dependent on the sustained presence of one of the initial driving genetic lesions, even though cancer cells may have acquired additional mutations. Indeed, oncogene addiction has been demonstrated for a short list of protein-coding genes in vivo [e.g., c-myc, BCR/ABL, Her-2, and p53 (6–7)], many of which are clinically validated therapeutic targets (8, 9). In the case of miRNAs, withdrawal of ectopic miR-21 is known to cause regression in a mouse model of lymphoma (10), indicating that some established lymphomas may be dependent on miR-21 overexpression.
200 Interestingly, recent studies on p53 demonstrate that the phenotype of oncogene addiction can be dependent on the stage of cancer progression (11, 12). In mouse lung cancer models driven by the loss of p53 and mutant k-ras, genetic restoration of p53 leads to significant loss of tumor mass in more advanced tumor cells but not in the earlier, less aggressive ones. These studies suggest that early-stage neoplasms may provide a context for complex oncogene addition phenomena. However, dependence on oncogene behavior in early-stage neoplasms in vivo has not been much explored in other types of malignancies. Myeloproliferative diseases (also known as myeloproliferative neoplasms, MPNs) are a collection of hematopoietic diseases with common features (reviewed in refs. 13 and 14), such as overproduction of one or more myeloid/erythroid/platelet lineages and splenomegaly. In some patients, the MPN will progress to acute myeloid leukemia, leading to the notion that MPN is one of the preleukemic states of a full-blown myeloid leukemia.
201 In this study, we used genomics and genetics to explore the role of miRNAs in MPN and the dependence of the early neoplastic MPN state on an oncogenic miRNA. We report a barcode genetic screen with the use of a unique miRNA expression library, which led to the identification of miR-125 miRNAs in inducing hypersensitivity toward cytokine signaling in both cell line and primary bone marrow cells. Using a unique inducible model for miRNA expression, we show that miR-125a–induced MPN display a complex manner of dependence on the continued expression of miR-125a. Although the hematopoietic phenotypes of the initial miR-125a–induced MPN appear reversible, re-exposure to the same oncogenic miRNA causes significantly altered disease manifestation, with damages in multiple tissues indicating irreversible systemic changes. Molecularly, we identify several protein phosphatases as previously unrecognized targets of miR-125a and the associated elevation in cellular tyrosine phosphorylation. Our work demonstrates that oncogenic miRNA dependence is not limited to advanced disease states. Our work also implies that profound systemic changes could occur during an early neoplastic disease state and its remission, which then modifies the nature of the lesion upon re-encountering the same oncogene.

205 Functional Genomics Screen Identified miR-125 Family miRNAs as Conferring Reduced Cytokine Dependence. Hematopoietic cells from MPN patients often display hypersensitivity toward cytokines (15⇓–17). To search for miRNAs that regulate cytokine sensitivity, we designed a barcode-based functional genomics screen in BaF3 cells, which strictly depends on IL-3 for survival and proliferation (18) (Fig. 1A). We constructed a retroviral miRNA expression library, by PCR-amplifying specific miRNA-encoding and flanking regions from human genomic DNA and inserting the amplified fragments into a retroviral vector. The resulted library contains 273 human miRNA expression constructs (see SI Methods and Dataset S1). The library vector supports overexpression in BaF3 cells (Fig. S1C). For the functional screen, we reasoned that BaF3 cells carrying a miRNA that confers reduced IL-3 dependence will have a growth advantage and be amplified under critically low IL-3 conditions. Consequently, this miRNA insert should be overrepresented in the cell pool after selection with low or no cytokine, compared with that before the selection. This overrepresentation should be detectable by quantifying the levels of construct-specific sequences (barcodes) in the genomic DNA of the transduced cell pool (Fig. 1A).

211 A functional screen identifies miR-125 family miRNAs conferring reduced cytokine dependence in BaF3 cells. (A) Schematic of the screen. BaF3 cells were infected with a pooled viral library containing 273 miRNAs. Genomic DNA was harvested before and after selection in low IL-3, amplified with construct-specific primers and detected on a bead-based platform. Colored hairpins and lines illustrate hypothetical miRNA integrations and amplicons. (B) A growth competition assay was used to validate candidate hits. BaF3 cells were infected with miR-125a, miR-125b or the control vector, which also expresses a GFP marker. Infected GFP+ cells were mixed with nontransduced cells. The percent GFP+ to percent GFP− ratios were measured by flow cytometry, following selection in low IL-3. Day 0 indicates the start of low IL-3 treatment. (C and D) Control vector, miR-125b (C) or miR-125a (D) constructs were used in the growth competition assay to assess their functions in BaF3 cells grown in low IL-3. Error bars represent SD.
212 We first asked whether there are miRNAs that can render complete IL-3 independence in BaF3 cells. We transduced BaF3 cells with the retroviral library, and then cultured them in complete absence of IL-3. Eight screen replicates from four independent viral transductions were performed (see Methods). Construct inserts were amplified with vector-specific biotinylated primers from the genomic DNA. PCR products were then hybridized to oligonucleotides coupled to a bead-based platform, which recognize mature miRNA sequences (1, 19) (Fig. 1A and Methods). However, no cells survived the zero IL-3 condition, suggesting that none of the miRNAs examined was capable of conferring complete IL-3 independence.
213 We next asked whether specific miRNAs can render reduced IL-3 dependence to allow preferential cell expansion under a critically low IL-3 concentration, which leads to slower proliferation as well as significant death. Screening in this condition identified miR-125b as one of the top candidate hits (Fig. S1 A and B and Dataset S1). MiR-125b belongs to the miR-125 family of miRNAs, which also includes miR-125a. Of note, the barcode for miR-125a was not detected above the detection threshold in the screen either before or after the low IL-3 selection, likely because of imperfect representation of constructs in the viral pool. Nevertheless, because of its sequence similarity with miR-125b, we also included miR-125a in the subsequent experiments. To validate the effect of miR-125a and miR-125b, we performed a growth competition assay (Fig. 1 B–D), which confirmed the role of these two miRNAs in inducing cytokine hypersensitivity in BaF3 cells. We used miR-125b-1 in all experiments because miR-125b-2 produces exactly the same mature product. Interestingly, the expression of miR-125a/b is highly enriched in hematopoietic stem cells (20⇓–22). Translocation and overexpression have been reported in acute myeloid leukemia and MPN patients (23⇓–25). Overexpression of miR-125a or miR-125b greatly enhances the hematopoietic stem cell pool and output, and can induce MPN in mice (21, 26). This result demonstrates the effectiveness of the screen to identify relevant MPN-inducing miRNAs, and suggest that miR-125 miRNAs may regulate cytokine signaling in primary cells.
214 Constitutive Overexpression of miR-125a Leads to MPN. Although leukemia is induced by overexpression of miR-125b in several models (21, 24, 26⇓–28), myeloproliferation could be the predominant effect of miR-125a overexpression (20, 29, 30). To address oncogene addiction in the context of MPN, we first assessed the effects of constitutive miR-125a overexpression in vivo to gauge the phenotypes of an inducible miR-125a model to be described later. Specifically, we transduced donor bone marrow cells with miR-125a or a control vector, each containing a GFP marker, and transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient animals. Although displaying prominent multilineage engraftment, miR-125a–recipient animals over time manifested multiple phenotypes indicative of an atypical MPN, including leukocytosis, monocytosis, splenomegaly, liver leukocyte infiltration, and progressive anemia (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2C). Leukocytosis in miR-125a recipients progressively worsened with time (Fig. S2A), which was the result of an increase in myeloid cells. Indeed, flow cytometry showed a significant elevation of the GFP+Mac1+ population in peripheral blood, which was accompanied by an increase in SSClowFSChi populations on scatter plots (Fig. 2 B and C). Consistent with this finding, the bone marrow of miR-125a recipients was dominated by myeloid cells (Fig. 2D and Figs. S3A and S4). The expanded myeloid population was composed of both monocytic and granulocytic lineages, with Ly6GhiLy6Clow and Ly6ChiLy6Glow cells expanded in the bone marrow (Fig. S4). The expansion of monocytic lineage is consistent with elevated monocyte counts in the peripheral blood (Fig. 2A).

(G) Liver leukocyte infiltration in miR-125a recipient mice. A representative H&E-stained liver section (4× lens) is shown, with arrows indicating infiltrating hematopoietic cells. Images within the black box was magnified and shown below.
221 In addition to myeloid cell expansion, miR-125a recipients displayed several additional features analogous to MPNs seen in some human patients, including splenomegaly and liver leukocyte infiltration (Fig. 2 E and G). The enlarged spleens contained a higher percentage of myeloid cells accompanied with structural effacement (Fig. S3B). Over time, many of the miR-125a recipient mice developed anemia, as indicated by their decreased hematocrit and red blood cell count (Fig. 2A, Fig. S2C, and Dataset S2), and blood smears showed signs of stressed erythropoiesis (Fig S2B). Indeed, miR-125a recipients showed pale bone color (Fig. 2F) and reduced erythrocytes in their bone marrow (Fig. S3A). The presence of anemia is consistent with the notion that overproduction of myeloid cells in the bone marrow displaces normal erythropoiesis. Similar to human MPNs, mature myeloid cells were present in miR-125a recipients (Fig. S2B). Taken together, the data above showed that miR-125a can induce an atypical myeloproliferative neoplasm in recipient animals.
222 We observed similar myeloid expansion phenotypes with miR-125b recipients (Fig. S5). However, their phenotypes were always weaker compared with the miR-125a recipients in parallel experiments, possibly because of lower expression levels. We thus focused on miR-125a in the subsequent studies.
223 Inducible in Vivo Model of miR-125a Recapitulates the Myeloproliferative Phenotype. To address whether miR-125a–induced MPN is dependent on this miRNA, we established an inducible expression system for miR-125a in vivo. We engineered a lentiviral vector (hereafter referred to as “i125a”), with the expression of miR-125a under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter, and with a constitutively expressed GFP marker to label the transduced cells (Fig. 3A). Bone marrow cells from Rosa26-rtTA mice (31) were transduced with the i125a vector and transplanted into lethally irradiated wild-type recipients to permit inducible miR-125a expression specifically in the hematopoietic compartment.

229 An in vivo model of inducible miR-125a expression. (A) Schematic of the inducible system. Bone marrow cells from Rosa26-rtTA mice were transduced with a lentivirus encoding miR-125a under the tet-O promoter, and transplanted into irradiated wild-type animals to achieve inducible miR-125a expression specifically in the hematopoietic compartment. (B and C) i125a recipient mice transplanted with a low dose of transduced HSPCs were maintained with or without Dox water. Peripheral blood cells were analyzed by flow cytometry at indicated time points with Mac1 and GFP. Representative flow cytometry plots (B) and the GFP+Mac1+ percentages (C) are shown. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.03, ***P < 0.03.
230 To evaluate the performance of this inducible system, we tested whether induction of miR-125a leads to an expansion of transduced hematopoietic cells, particularly the myeloid cells. To maximize the readout sensitivity, we first transplanted a limited number of transduced hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Recipient mice receiving i125a-transduced cells were randomly divided into two groups, one of which was put on doxycylcine water (on Dox), whereas the other group was maintained on regular water (without Dox). We confirmed that the expression level of miR-125a could be modulated by doxycycline in recipient mice (Fig. S6A). Mice that were maintained without Dox had lower levels of GFP+ cells in their peripheral blood, which became more pronounced with time. By 2 mo, mice without Dox had significantly lower levels of engraftment and lower percentages of Mac1+GFP+ cells (< 2%) (Fig. 3 B and C). In contrast, 100% (five of five) of mice on Dox showed higher levels of GFP+ myeloid cells at 3 wk posttransplantation, and lasted until at least 3 mo posttransplantation (Fig. 3 B and C). These data indicate that inducible expression of miR-125a can lead to myeloid expansion in a Dox-dependent manner. However, no overt abnormality in differential blood parameters was observed at this input cell dosage.
231 We then modeled the MPN phenotype by transplanting a larger number of transduced HSPCs. Indeed, induction of miR-125a recapitulated the phenotypes associated with the atypical MPN observed with the constitutive miR-125a model. The mice developed leukocytosis and monocytosis, which worsened with prolonged Dox induction (Fig. 4 A and B, and Fig. S6B). In contrast, mice treated with Dox alone did not exhibit such phenotypes (Dataset S3). Significant increases in GFP+Mac1+ cells occurred in both peripheral blood and bone marrow, leading to GFP+ cells dominating the Mac1+ myeloid population (Fig. 4 C and D), with associated expansion of the characteristic SSClowFSChi populations (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the mice developed splenomegaly (Fig. 4E). We only observed progressive anemia in a small number of i125a mice on Dox (Fig. S7A). Pale bone color was nonetheless present even though the red cell parameters remained within the normal range for most animals (Fig. 4F and Fig. S7A). This observation is consistent with the notion that the anemic phenotype is a consequence of myeloid expansion disrupting normal erythropoiesis, which may exhibit different severity depending on the extent of myeloproliferation. Taken together, the data above show that the inducible i125a model recapitulates the MPN phenotypes of the constitutive model.

237 Dependence on miR-125a expression in the MPN model. (A and B) i125a recipient mice were maintained on doxycyline (on Dox) after transplantation and their hematopoietic parameters were monitored over time. Each line represents one animal. Dox was switched off (off Dox) for a subgroup of these animals (red lines), at the time point indicated by the vertical red arrows. Peripheral blood WBC (A) and monocyte (B) counts are shown. P < 0.01 for WBC and P < 0.02 for monocytes, comparing before and after 2 wk of switching off Dox. n = 4 for off Dox and n = 10 for on Dox. A representative cohort is shown. (C and D) Representative flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood (C) and bone marrow cells (D). The same animal on Dox and off Dox is shown in C. Red arrows in C indicate the characteristic expanded populations on scatter plot. (E and F) Spleens and tibiae of mice that are wild-type, or i125a recipients maintained on Dox, or switched off Dox.
238 miR-125a–Induced Primary MPN Phenotypes Are Dependent on Its Sustained Overexpression. Having established an in vivo inducible model of miR-125a, we then asked whether the MPN is dependent on miR-125a overexpression. i125a mice that were kept on Dox were monitored for their peripheral blood parameters. Four mice on Dox with high white blood cell counts at 3 mo posttransplant were switched off doxycycline (off Dox), whereas the rest of the cohort was maintained on Dox induction. Within 2 wk after switching off Dox, the peripheral white blood cell counts and monocyte counts returned to normal range (Fig. 4 A and B, and Fig. S8A), whereas mice kept on Dox continued to have high white cell and monocyte counts (Fig. 4 A and B). The reduction in white cell count in the off Dox mice was accompanied by a strong reduction in GFP+ percentage in both peripheral blood and bone marrow (Fig. 4 C and D), indicating that the decrease of i125a-GFP cells was underlying the normalization of blood parameters. Further examination showed that the spleen size of off Dox mice returned back to normal size, indistinguishable from that of wild-type animals (Fig. 4E). These data indicate that the overproduction of myeloid cells was corrected after stopping inducible miR-125a expression.
239 We next examined whether erythropoiesis was restored after switching off Dox. Indeed, the bone color of the off Dox mice returned to a level of redness similar to that seen with wild-type animals (Fig. 4F), indicating more effective bone marrow erythropoiesis. This finding prompted us to examine the few mice that did develop significant anemia with Dox induction. Invariably, significant rebound of red cell parameters was observed after switching off Dox (Fig. S7B). Even in mice that did not show red cell parameters below the anemic cutoff, discontinuation of Dox administration led to improved red blood cell parameters in three out of four animals (Fig. S7C). Taken together, the data above show remarkable correction of the hematopoietic phenotypes of MPN after switching off miR-125a induction.
240 Repeated miR-125a Overexpression Results in Complex Outcomes. To model reoccurrence of oncogenic lesion following a period of remission, we assessed the effects of miR-125a re-exposure in our inducible model. Four mice (from two cohorts) that had their initial MPN corrected after withdrawing Dox treatment were administered Dox for a second time. Instead of a uniform manifestation of the same MPN seen with the first Dox induction, the repeated Dox treatment led to unexpected complex disease outcomes. Only in one of four mice was a similar MPN induced with the second exposure (Dataset S4, mouse #4). Surprisingly however, three of four mice quickly became moribund, at which point eight of nine mice that remained on Dox all of the time were still alive (Dataset S4) (P = 0.05 Fisher’s exact test). This rapid lethality occurred within 5–7 wk upon reinitiation of miR-125a overexpression. Myeloproliferation and splenomegaly were absent or only mild (Dataset S4). Detailed hematopoietic and pathological examination showed that lethal anemia was present in mice (two of four) (Dataset S4) with severe spleen damage. Stromal collapse and fibrosis is prominent in these spleens (Figs. S9A and S10). Importantly, splenic lesions of this nature was not present in recipient animals that received control vector-transduced cells, or remained on continuous Dox induction (Figs. S9A and S10), or in the constitutive 125a model (Fig. S3B), strongly suggesting that it was a consequence of off-Dox treatment. Notably, spleen was also the major site of extramedullary hematopoiesis with constitutive miR-125a overexpression (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3B), with the enlarged spleen supporting red cell production to compensate for ineffective bone marrow erythropoiesis. The severe spleen damage and relatively normal spleen size in these mice provide a plausible explanation for the development of lethal anemia. Finally, rapid lethality (one of four mice) was seen with extreme hematopoietic infiltration into the lung (Fig. S9B). The data above demonstrate that re-exposure to miR-125a is associated with complex outcomes, with some animals developing systemic changes that alter the overall disease manifestation.
241 miR-125a Potentiates Cytokine Sensitivity, Targets Protein Phosphatases, and Elevates Cellular Protein Phosphorylation. To shed light on the mechanism of miR-125a, we extended on the finding that miR-125a induces IL-3 hypersensitivity in BaF3 cells and asked whether cytokine hypersensitivity could also be seen with bone marrow cells. To this end, we performed myeloid colony formation assays with bone marrow cells from miR-125a recipients or control vector recipients, using different concentrations of IL-3 or GM-CSF. At the highest dose of either cytokine, similar numbers of colonies were formed by miR-125a and control bone marrow cells, indicating that forced expression of miR-125a did not increase the frequency of clonogenic progenitors at permissive growth conditions with abundant supportive signaling (Fig. 5A). At a low concentration (0.01 ng/mL) of IL-3 or GM-CSF however, control bone marrow cells completely lost the ability to produce colonies, whereas miR-125a bone marrow still gave rise to small but robust colonies (Fig. 5 A and B). Even in the complete absence of IL-3 or GM-CSF, a small number of colonies were still present in miR-125a cultures (Fig. S8B). These data indicate that miR-125a potentiates cytokine sensitivity in primary cells.

247 miR-125a regulates cytokine hypersensitivity and targets multiple protein phosphatases. (A and B) miR-125a-recipient bone marrow cells show cytokine hypersensitivity. Bone marrow cells from control vector (Ctrl) or miR-125a recipient animals were plated for colony formation assay with indicated concentrations of IL-3 or GM-CSF. Colonies were scored and photographed on day 10. (A) Colony numbers per well. n = 4 for each condition. Arrows indicate that zero colonies were observed for Ctrl bone marrow cells at the corresponding concentration. (B) Representative colony morphology at indicated concentrations (conc) of IL-3 or GM-CSF. (C) Cellular phospho-tyrosine (p-Tyr) levels increased in miR-125a-expressing cells. BaF3 cells were transduced with a control construct or miR-125a construct, with GFP labeling transduced cells. Cells were cultured under low IL-3 and low serum condition, and p-Tyr levels were measured with flow cytometry, gating on both GFP+ (transduced) and GFP− (nontransduced) fractions. Bone marrow cells from control-vector or miR-125a recipients were analyzed with p-Tyr. Because of the minimal levels of GFP− cells in miR-125a recipients, only data on GFP+ cells are shown. All flow cytometry plots were representative of two or more experiments. (D) The 3′ UTR luciferase reporters of indicated genes were analyzed with miR-125a. Normalized luciferase activities are shown, with a value of 1 indicating no effect on the 3′ UTR. n = 6 for control, PTPN7, PTPN18, and PPP1R16A; n = 3 for others. *P < 0.05. (E) Wild-type PTPN18 3′ UTR reporter, and a mutant reporter with mutation in a putative miR-125a site, were assayed with control or miR-125a construct. Normalized luciferase activities are shown. The activity of the UTR-less reporter in the presence of control and miR-125a construct is set to 1. n = 3. *P < 0.05. (F) Erythroid myeloid lymphoid cells transduced with control or miR-125a construct were measured for PTPN18 mRNA expression using microarray. n = 3. *P < 0.05. For all figures, error bars represent SD.
248 Regulation of signaling downstream of cytokines involves protein phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation in multiple signaling cascades (reviewed in ref. 32). We thus examined whether phosphatases, including tyrosine phosphatases, may be targeted by miR-125a. TargetScan predicts multiple phosphatases as potential miR-125a targets. To validate these predictions, we cloned the 3′ UTRs of eight phosphatases or related genes into luciferase reporters. miR-125a significantly down-regulated the 3′ UTR reporters of multiple protein phosphatases, including protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPN18 and PTPN7 (Fig. 5D). miR-125a also targeted serine/threonine phosphatases PPP1CA and PPP2CA (Fig. 5D), similar to miR-125b (33). We next used PTPN18 as an example for further characterization, which is a gene with enriched expression in HSPCs (34⇓–36). Mutation of a putative miR-125 binding site in PTPN18 3′ UTR abolished the targeting by miR-125a (Fig. 5E), demonstrating a direct targeting effect. Although we were not able to assess the endogenous protein level because of the lack of a reliable antibody, we did observe a down-regulation of the endogenous PTPN18 mRNA with miR-125a overexpression (Fig. 5F). These data demonstrate that miR-125a targets protein phosphatases and suggest its modulation of cellular protein phosphorylation. This is indeed true, because BaF3 cells and primary bone marrow cells expressing miR-125a showed higher protein tyrosine phosphorylation than corresponding controls (Fig. 5C). These findings illustrate the protein phosphatases as a class of common targets by classic hematopoietic oncogenes, such as BCR-ABL (37), and a noncoding small RNA miR-125a.

251 Discussion
252 In this study, we examined the role of miR-125a in an in vivo model of MPN and report the complex nature of dependence on an oncogenic miRNA. Unlike the previously reported case of oncogene addiction to miR-21, which resulted in lymphoma formation in mice (10), overexpression of miR-125a resulted in a neoplasm with excessive expansion of the myeloid lineage, representing an early neoplastic stage. Contrasting the lack of oncogene addiction when p53 is restored in early-stage lung adenocarcinomas (18, 19), switching off exogenous miR-125a led to rapid resolution of MPN phenotypes and normalization of hematopoietic parameters. These data demonstrate that MPN induced by miR-125a is dependent on its continued overexpression. However, a repeat of miR-125a overexpression led to significant altered phenotypes, with some mice showing severe damages in spleen and lung. These data show the complexity of oncogenic miRNA dependence and suggest that irreversible systemic damages caused by oncogene inhibition could be an important modifier for host response to a subsequent wave of oncogenic events.
253 We demonstrated and validated the utility of a unique barcode functional genomics screen system that identified miR-125 miRNAs as conferring reduced cytokine dependence. Although we have not validated other candidates, we believe the list of candidates can be interesting miRNAs to explore in the future. The miRNA expression library constructed in this study is one of the few libraries available for the broader miRNA community. Unlike previous efforts that used microarrays for detecting barcode changes (38, 39), we used a unique bead-based platform for barcode detection. Compared with microarray or deep sequencing, the bead-based detection platform is much more cost-effective, and is flexible enough to incorporate additional barcode detectors (1). This platform provides the feasibility to detect large numbers of samples at low cost, a feature that can be particularly useful when considering detailed time-course experiments, with many replicates or experimental conditions. We further envision that this system can be applied to in vivo functional screens, which likely will require multiple cohorts of animals over multiple time points.
254 In this study, we also show that miR-125a induces cytokine hypersensitivity both in cell line and in bone marrow cells. This hypersensitivity is reflected by increased global tyrosine phosphorylation in cells. We demonstrate that miR-125a targets multiple protein phosphatases, providing a possible mechanistic explanation for the effects on protein phosphorylation and cytokine sensitivity. Strikingly, mice defective in several phosphatases display MPN-like phenotypes (40⇓⇓⇓–44). In addition, severe lung pathology is present in mice deficient in tyrosine phosphatase PTPN6 (44) and SH2-containing inositol-5-phosphatase (SHIP) (41). Furthermore, potentiation of colony growth at low cytokine concentrations and an increase in colony sizes were documented for mice null of SHIP (41). These observations indicate that disruption of phosphatase activity can lead to MPN, and suggest incomplete inhibition of multiple phosphatases by miR-125a may lead to cooperative outcomes in MPN formation. Other targets of miR-125 have been previously characterized by us and other groups (reviewed in ref. 45) and are still growing in numbers. With a long list of over 800 predicted targets (TargetScan), it is highly likely that cooperation among multiple targets, including protein phosphatases, is responsible for the overall MPN phenotypic manifestation.

327 Abstract
328 Most of what is presently known about how miRNAs regulate gene expression comes from studies that characterized the regulatory effect of miRNA binding sites located in the 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of mRNAs. In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that miRNAs also bind in the coding region (CDS), but the implication of these interactions remains obscure because they have a smaller impact on mRNA stability compared with miRNA-target interactions that involve 3' UTRs. Here we show that miRNA-complementary sites that are located in both CDS and 3'-UTRs are under selection pressure and share the same sequence and structure properties. Analyzing recently published data of ribosome-protected fragment profiles upon miRNA transfection from the perspective of the location of miRNA-complementary sites, we find that sites located in the CDS are most potent in inhibiting translation, while sites located in the 3' UTR are more efficient at triggering mRNA degradation. Our study suggests that miRNAs may combine targeting of CDS and 3' UTR to flexibly tune the time scale and magnitude of their post-transcriptional regulatory effects.
329 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~21 nt (nucleotide)-long regulatory RNAs that are encoded in the genomes of species ranging from viruses to human. They form miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISCs) with Argonaute proteins which they guide, through hybridization, to target mRNAs whose expression is subsequently down-regulated (Bushati and Cohen 2007; Bartel 2009). In plants, miRNAs typically trigger the endonucleolytic cleavage of their targets through perfect or near-perfect complementarity interactions with transcript coding regions (CDS) (Jones-Rhoades et al. 2006). In contrast, in mammals they have been shown to interact predominantly through their �seed region� (nucleotides 2�8 from the 5' end of the miRNA) with 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of mRNAs (Lewis et al. 2005), inducing their destabilization and translational inhibition (Filipowicz et al. 2008). In recent years, the distinction between the mode of action of plant and animal miRNAs has become less clear. There is growing evidence that plant miRNAs can induce translational repression via imperfect complementarity interactions with target sites in CDS and 3' UTRs (Brodersen et al. 2008; Lanet et al. 2009). Likewise, increasingly many miRNA target sites are discovered in coding regions of mammalian transcripts (Forman et al. 2008; Huang et al. 2010; Qin et al. 2010; Ott et al. 2011). Application of high-throughput approaches for isolating Argonaute-bound target sites indicates that CDS sites are as numerous as those located in 3' UTRs (Chi et al. 2009; Hafner et al. 2010), though the density of Argonaute-bound sites is higher in 3' UTR compared with CDS (Hafner et al. 2010).
330 If CDS sites are as common as Argonaute cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) studies indicate (Chi et al. 2009; Hafner et al. 2010), one wonders why there are relatively few reports on their involvement in gene regulation and why the studies that have been so far published suggest that CDS sites are much less effective in down-regulating mRNA levels upon miRNA transfection (Baek et al. 2008; Hafner et al. 2010; Fang and Rajewsky 2011; Schnall-Levin et al. 2011). A reason may be that CDS sites function in specific contexts, in which coding regions are accessible to the miRNA-loaded silencing complex, while under normal conditions the process of translation hinders miRNA binding to these sites (Bartel 2009; Gu et al. 2009). Alternatively, it may be that only a specific subset of miRNAs targets coding regions. For instance, it has recently been found that hsa-miR-181a targets multiple members of the C2H2 zinc finger domain family, through multiple CDS sites that occur precisely in the regions of the transcripts that encode the C2H2 domains (Schnall-Levin et al. 2011). However, the CDS sites that have been isolated in CLIP experiments do not seem to correspond to a restricted subset of miRNAs, and they also did not require that the cells were treated in some specific way to expose the use of CDS sites. Thus, none of the hypotheses mentioned above can explain the discrepancy between the apparent abundance of CDS sites and the paucity of reports about their function.
331 Evolutionary conservation has been successfully employed to predict regulatory elements, including binding sites for miRNAs in 3' UTRs (Krek et al. 2005; Lewis et al. 2005; Gaidatzis et al. 2007). Hurst (2006) used a limited experimentally verified data set that was available at the time to demonstrate that miRNA target sites located in coding regions exhibit significantly low evolutionary rates in mammals. Evolutionary conservation-based approaches to predict miRNA target sites in coding regions followed. Forman et al. (2008) used alignments of CDS regions in 17 species to identify conserved miRNA-complementary sites in 700 human genes. Among the miRNAs with the most predicted CDS sites were hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-125a-5p, and hsa-miR-153. These authors further demonstrated experimentally that hsa-let-7b-5p down-regulates the miRNA-processing enzyme Dicer, whose transcript carries multiple complementarities to let-7 in its coding region. Schnall-Levin et al. (2010) allowed for the possibility that sites are not perfectly conserved among �all� genomes used in the inference to show that miRNA targeting in CDS is as common as in the 3' UTRs in Drosophila species. They further predicted 26,000 and 14,000 sites in human 3' UTR and CDS regions, respectively. Finally, Fang and Rajewsky (2011) found evidence that mRNAs that are simultaneously targeted in the CDS and in the 3' UTR are slightly more destabilized than mRNA targeted only in the 3' UTR, while Schnall-Levin et al. (2011) showed that mRNAs with several miRNA binding sites in the CDS can effectively be degraded.
332 In the present study we analyzed putative miRNA target sites that are located in coding regions, with the aim of uncovering the function of such sites by comparison with sites that are located in 3' UTRs. The target sites that we used in our analysis were either predicted computationally or inferred on the basis of transcript- or protein-level changes following miRNA transfections. Our results indicate that CDS and 3' UTR target sites co-evolved, have similar sequence and structure properties, and may have similar efficiency in inducing translational repression of the transcripts in which they reside. On the other hand, sites located in 3' UTR are much more effective at inducing mRNA degradation, as reported before (Baek et al. 2008; Guo et al. 2010; Hafner et al. 2010; Fang and Rajewsky 2011).

335 Results
336 Both CDS and 3' UTR sites are under evolutionary selection
337 The application of the ElMMo model to miRNA target prediction in 3' UTRs was described before (Gaidatzis et al. 2007) and recent assessments indicate that ElMMo is among the most accurate miRNA target prediction methods available (Alexiou et al. 2009; Hafner et al. 2010; Sturm et al. 2010). ElMMo is parameter-free and, by building its background model from the appropriate type of regions, it can in principle predict miRNA target sites in transcript or genomic regions that do not correspond to 3' UTRs. Here we applied ElMMo to predict miRNA target sites in coding regions. To determine whether the ElMMo-predicted CDS sites are functional we analyzed eight published data sets (listed in Table 1) that compared mRNA expression before and after transfections of individual miRNAs. In each of these experiments, we identified all mRNAs that carried precisely one 2�8 seed match to the transfected miRNA, and we selected 250 transcripts that were most down-regulated and 250 that responded least to transfection. We separated each of these sets in two subsets: transcripts in which the site was located in the CDS, and transcripts in which the site was located in the 3' UTR. We then computed the t-values comparing the ElMMo scores of the sites that induced an effect with those that did not induce an effect and we computed the overall t-value over the data sets. As Figure 1A (and Supplemental Fig. 1) shows, both CDS and 3' UTR sites that are located in down-regulated transcripts have a higher probability to be under selection compared with sites that are located in transcripts that do not respond to transfection. We further asked whether miRNA-complementary sites that are isolated in Argonaute CLIP experiments also have higher ElMMo scores compared with those that are not isolated (Fig. 1A). We used the Argonaute CLIP data of Kishore et al. (2011) (Table 1) and identified all matches to the 2�8 seed of the top 10 expressed miRNA families in transcripts from which CLIP reads were obtained. In principle, these transcripts were expressed and bound by Argonaute proteins, so the transfected miRNAs should have had access to all seed-matching sites in these transcripts. We separated the set of seed matches into those that were the most enriched in CLIP and those that were least enriched in CLIP and compared the distributions of ElMMo scores of the two subsets of sites. As shown in Figure 1A (and Supplemental Fig. 1), we found that CLIPed CDS sites had a significantly higher score compared with non-CLIPed sites. These results indicate that ElMMo predicts functional sites not only in 3' UTRs but also in CDSs.

346 Figure 1.
347 (A) CDS- and 3' UTR-located miRNA binding sites that induce mRNA degradation or are isolated in EIF2C2 CLIP experiments are under stronger selection pressure compared with miRNA-complementary sites that were not functional in these experiments; 2274 CDS- and 3956 3' UTR-located sites that induce mRNA degradation are compared with 3513 CDS- and 3268 3' UTR-located sites that do not induce mRNA degradation; 751 CDS- and 786 3' UTR-located sites isolated in EIF2C2 CLIP experiments are compared with 1059 CDS- and 956 3' UTR-located sites that do not induce EIF2C2 binding. (B) Scatter plot of the inferred probabilities that CDS- and 3' UTR-located sites complementary to individual miRNAs are under selection. (Dashed red line) First principal component of the scatter.
348 ElMMo further estimates a miRNA-specific probability that a site that is complementary to the miRNA in the reference species (in this case human) is under selection in at least one other species taken into account in the miRNA target prediction. Here we used genome sequence data of the species Pan troglodytes, Rhesus maccacus, Canis familiaris, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Bos taurus, Monodelphis domestica, and Gallus gallus to predict sites that are under evolutionary selection. This probability is high when the miRNA-complementary motifs are strongly conserved and low when they are weakly conserved across species, relative to motifs that are not complementary to miRNAs. As shown in Figure 1B, the probabilities of miRNA-complementary sites to be under selection pressure are strongly correlated between CDS- and 3' UTR-located sites of individual miRNAs (r = 0.77). For comparison, we estimated the average phastCons conservation score (Siepel et al. 2005) for CDS and 3' UTR occurrences of individual motifs, and found a similar but weaker correlation (Supplemental Fig. 8). Further supporting the functionality of miRNA-complementary sites located in both CDS and 3' UTR, the phastCons scores of these motifs are significantly higher compared with those of other 7mers in both types of regions (Supplemental Fig. 8). These results suggest that CDS and 3' UTR sites evolve in parallel and that CDS sites must have a function that confers a selective advantage in evolution.
349 miRNAs that function in embryonic development co-target the 3' UTR and the CDS
350 The proportion of miRNA-complementary sites estimated to be under evolutionary selection in CDS as opposed to 3' UTRs differs between miRNAs (Fig. 2A). We found that this is due to a combination of factors. First, the sequence composition of CDS and 3' UTR differ, with the result that some motifs are more abundant in CDS and others in 3' UTR (Supplemental Fig. 9). Additionally, the relative lengths of CDS and 3' UTR of the targeted transcripts and the relative selection pressure on miRNA-complementary motifs in the two types of regions (Supplemental Fig. 10) also contribute to preferential targeting of CDS vs. 3' UTR. Interestingly, miRNAs that contain the AGCAGC motif at the 5' end (hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-15a/b-5p, hsa-miR-195-5p, hsa-miR-103-3p, hsa-miR-107, hsa-miR-646, hsa-miR-424-5p, hsa-miR-497-5p) and that have been previously shown to regulate cell cycle (Linsley et al. 2007; Fulci et al. 2009; Forrest et al. 2010; Balatti et al. 2011) have many more complementary sites in the CDS compared with 3' UTR (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, motifs that are complementary to miRNAs with embryonic expression�hsa-miR-302a-3p, hsa-miR-369-3p, hsa-miR-372, hsa-miR-373-3p, hsa-miR-374b/c-5p (Suh et al. 2004), the homologs of which have been shown to be involved in maternal mRNA clearance in zebrafish (Giraldez et al. 2006)�or to the oncogenic miRNAs of the miR-17 family�hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-20a/b-5p, hsa-miR-93-5p, hsa-miR-106a/b-5p (He et al. 2005)�are more frequent in the 3' UTRs (see also Supplemental Table 1).

356 Individual miRNAs differ in their preference for targeting the CDS and the 3' UTR as well as in their tendency to simultaneously target the CDS and the 3' UTR of individual genes.

(Red dots) miRNAs with statistically significant co-targeting enrichment (P < 0.05 in Fisher's test after Bonferroni correction).
357 Given that a large fraction of miRNAs appear to prefer targeting of either the CDS or the 3' UTR, we asked whether some miRNAs tend to simultaneously target the 3' UTR and the CDS of the same transcript. To answer this question, we determined the number of genes that contained both one of the 250 highest-scoring CDS binding sites and one of the 250 highest-scoring 3' UTR sites for a given miRNA, as predicted by the ElMMo algorithm. We then determined the fold enrichments in the number of such co-targeted genes relative to what would be expected if miRNAs targeted the CDS and the 3' UTR independently (see section �Enrichments in the number of genes co-targeted in the CDS and in the 3' UTR� in Methods). We found significant evidence of CDS and 3' UTR co-targeting for 62 human miRNAs (P < 0.05 at Fisher's exact test after Bonferroni correction; see Supplemental Table 2). Among these were many miRNAs with important functions: the epithelial cell-specific (Gregory et al. 2008) hsa-miR-141-3p/200a-3p (P < 10-11), the embryonic stem cell-expressed (Suh et al. 2004; Stadler et al. 2010) hsa-miR-302/372/373-3p/520a-3p (P < 10-8), the oncogenic component of the mir-17/92 cluster hsa-miR-19a-3p (P < 10-6) (Ventura et al. 2008; Olive et al. 2009), the oncogenic hsa-miR-130b-3p/hsa-miR-301a-3p miRNAs (P < 10-6) (Shi et al. 2011), and the hsa-miR-137 (P < 10-6), that is involved in neural maturation (Smrt et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2011).
358 The tendency for these miRNAs to target both the CDS and the 3' UTR of individual mRNAs cannot be explained by a general tendency of motif co-occurrence in the CDS and 3' UTR of the same transcripts because co-targeting enrichments beyond threefold are very rarely observed for random motifs (Supplemental Fig. 11). Interestingly, the miRNAs for which we find evidence for CDS and 3' UTR co-targeting are among those that preferentially target 3' UTRs (P-value of the average CDS vs. 3' UTR preference for these miRNAs is significantly >0, P < 10-15; see �Statistical evidence that CDS and 3' UTR co-targeting occurs mostly for miRNAs that preferentially target 3' UTRs� in Methods). This is illustrated in Figure 2B. Each dot in the figure represents a miRNA. The x-axis shows the preference of the miRNA for CDS vs. 3' UTR targeting defined as the signed distance to the line representing the scaling between the number of CDS and 3' UTR sites (Fig. 2A) for the respective miRNA. The y-axis shows the co-targeting enrichment. miRNAs that target the CDS and 3' UTR of the same transcripts significantly more often than expected by chance appear in red. Interestingly, overexpression of most of these CDS/3' UTR-co-targeting miRNAs has been linked with tumorigenesis (Voorhoeve et al. 2006; Huang et al. 2008; Olive et al. 2009; Mateescu et al. 2011; Shi et al. 2011).
359 Functional CDS and 3' UTR binding sites have similar sequence and structure properties
360 Previously, we found that miRNA binding sites that are located in 3' UTRs and are effective in mRNA degradation have specific properties such as structural accessibility and a U-rich sequence context (Hausser et al. 2009). We further found that highly conserved miRNA target sites share these properties, suggesting that miRNA target sites in 3' UTRs have been selected in evolution based on their ability to induce mRNA degradation. We therefore asked whether target sites that are located in the CDS and are functional according to the criteria we defined for 3' UTR sites also share these properties. As before (Hausser et al. 2009), we took a systematic approach, making use of microarray, CLIP, pSILAC, and SILAC measurements as well as the predicted target sites that we obtained above, with their associated posterior probabilities (Table 1). Functional target sites were defined as those that had a high posterior probability of being under evolutionary selection or those whose associated transcripts or proteins responded in miRNA transfection experiments (see Methods). Nonfunctional target sites were defined as those that had a low posterior probability of being under evolutionary selection or whose associated transcripts or proteins did not respond in miRNA transfection experiments. For each target site, we computed 32 properties that quantify the structure and sequence context of miRNA binding sites (listed in section 1.2 of the Supplemental Material). We then calculated the t-value quantifying the difference between the mean values taken by the properties among the functional and nonfunctional target sites. A summary of the obtained t-values is shown in Figure 3 and indicates that CDS- and 3' UTR-located miRNA binding sites have largely similar properties (see also Supplemental Figs. 1�7, 12). In particular, U-rich and structurally accessible environments characterize functional miRNA target sites, irrespective of their location in CDS or 3' UTRs. The correlation is considerably smaller for sites obtained based on measurement of protein expression changes for reasons that are presently unknown (Hausser et al. 2009). These results again suggest that both types of sites experience similar selective constraints and should be equally functional.

365 Figure 3.
366 CDS and 3' UTR sites share common sequence and structure properties. Sets of functional and nonfunctional binding sites were defined according to four different criteria�selective pressure, efficacy in mRNA degradation, efficacy in reducing protein levels, and binding to EIF2C2�each corresponding to a different panel. We then compared t-values obtained in comparing functional and nonfunctional sites from CDS (x-axis) and 3' UTR (y-axis) regions. Each property is represented in each plot as a dot. Positive and negative values denote positive and negative predictors of functional miRNA binding sites, respectively.
367 mRNA destabilization occurs mainly when miRNAs bind to sites in 3' UTRs
368 To investigate the possible function of CDS-located miRNA target sites, we first compiled, from the miRNA transfection experiments of Linsley et al. (2007) and Grimson et al. (2007), transcripts that satisfied one of the following four mutually exclusive constraints. They had either no seed match to the transfected miRNA in either CDS or 3' UTR, or precisely one seed match in the CDS, or precisely one seed match located in the 3' UTR, or precisely two seed matches, one in the CDS and the other in the 3' UTR. A seed match was again defined as a match to positions 2�8 of the transfected miRNA. Figure 4 shows that compared with 3' UTR sites, CDS sites have a smaller, though still significant effect in inducing the degradation of the host transcripts. At least in some data sets, transcripts that carry both types of sites are down-regulated to a significantly lower level compared with transcripts that have only one type of site (not shown), consistent with what Fang and Rajewsky (2011) reported based on the analysis of the Baek et al. (2008) and Selbach et al. (2008) data sets.

373 Figure 4.
374 mRNA destabilization occurs mainly through sites located in the 3' UTR. Shown are log2 fold changes in mRNA levels upon miRNA transfection in the experiments of (A) Linsley et al. (2007) and (B) Grimson et al. (2007). mRNAs with binding sites located in the CDS only, in the 3' UTR only, and in both CDS and in 3' UTR were analyzed separately. Fold changes were normalized to the average fold change of mRNAs that did not contain canonical binding sites to the transfected miRNA.
375 CDS binding sites can effectively inhibit translation
376 Although miRNAs significantly reduce the mRNA levels of their targets (Bagga et al. 2005; Lewis et al. 2005), the initial paradigm was that miRNAs inhibit translation without affecting mRNA levels (Lee et al. 1993; Wightman et al. 1993), and the relative contribution of these mechanisms is still a matter of debate (Eulalio et al. 2008; Filipowicz et al. 2008; B�thune et al. 2012; David 2012). Recently, as a way to assess the extent of translation inhibition, Guo et al. (2010) measured changes in ribosome occupancy upon miRNA transfection transcriptome-wide. They found that at 32 h post-transfection, the reduction in ribosome occupancy of transcripts with miRNA binding sites in 3' UTRs could be attributed in very large measure (84%) to the reduction in mRNA levels.
377 We asked whether this observation holds equally true for transcripts with miRNA-complementary sites that are located not in the 3' UTR but rather in the CDS. We therefore analyzed the behavior of transcripts carrying a single miRNA seed match in the CDS and transcripts in which the single miRNA seed match occurred in the 3' UTRs in the data of Guo et al. (2010). The data set included mRNA and ribosome occupancy levels at 12 and at 32 h post-transfection, which we analyzed as described in �Processing of quantitative proteomics, microarrays and deep sequencing data� in Methods. As shown in Figure 5 and previously reported by Guo et al. (2010), transcripts that are targeted in the 3' UTR are strongly down-regulated at 32 h after transfection, and their ribosome occupancy at this time largely reflects the mRNA level. Transcripts in which the single miRNA seed match occurred in the CDS exhibit a similar behavior, though the reduction in their mRNA levels is more limited. Surprisingly, we found that transcripts with a single miRNA seed match in the CDS exhibited a significant reduction in ribosome occupancy at 12 h post-transfection that was not due to a corresponding reduction in mRNA levels (�translation, 12 h� bars in Fig. 5). In addition, the reduction in ribosome occupancy was increased for mRNAs with two miRNA seed matches in the CDS, corresponding to an estimated 18% reduction in the translation rate (Supplemental Fig. 13). This suggests that miRNA binding sites that are located in CDS are effective in inducing translational inhibition immediately after miRNA transfection while sites located in the 3' UTR sites are effective in down-regulating the mRNA levels.

383 CDS-located binding sites transiently inhibit translation in miRNA transfection experiments. The figure shows log2 fold changes in mRNA levels (mRNA-seq), and ribosome-protected fragments (rpf) 12 and 32 h after hsa-miR-155-5p and hsa-miR-1 transfection. Changes in translation were estimated from the difference between changes in rpf and changes in mRNA levels. mRNAs with precisely one seed match to the transfected miRNA in the CDS and no seed match in the 3' UTR were analyzed separately from mRNAs with precisely one seed match in the 3' UTR and no seed match in the CDS. Fold changes were determined relative to the average fold change of mRNAs with no seed matches.
384 To assess the generality of these findings we revisited the data from a very recent study that investigated the miRNA-induced translational inhibition and mRNA degradation during maternal-zygotic transition in zebrafish (Bazzini et al. 2012). In contrast to Guo et al. (2010), who concluded that miRNAs have very limited effects on translation, Bazzini et al. (2012) identified a kinetic aspect of the miRNA-induced response. Namely, expression of the dre-miR-430 miRNAs caused an initial, transient, translational repression of the targets that was followed by the degradation of their corresponding mRNAs. Both CDS and 3'UTR sites were found to have a qualitatively similar effect, though CDS sites were much less effective than 3'UTR site (Bazzini et al. 2012). Reanalyzing the data of Bazzini et al. (2012) we found, as before, that CDS-located sites appear to induce translational repression at the early time points but are not effective in mRNA degradation (Supplemental Fig. 14). In contrast, 3' UTR-located sites induce transient translational repression followed by mRNA degradation. We further analyzed transcriptomics and proteomics data that were obtained a week after the induction of miR-223 deletion in mouse (Baek et al. 2008). As shown in Supplemental Figure 15, the expression levels of mRNAs with CDS sites change very little upon knockout of miR-223 whereas their translation increases in the absence of the miRNA to a degree comparable to the translation of transcripts with binding sites in 3' UTRs. Finally, we constructed reporters to measure the effect of a miRNA on the protein and mRNA level of miRNA targets with CDS-located target sites. First, we generated a HEK293T stable cell line containing an episomal pRTS-1 vector from which the expression of hsa-miR-124-3p can be induced with doxycyclin. We then selected two conserved CDS miR-124 target sites that were represented with a relatively high number of reads in the EIF2C2 (also known as Ago2) CLIP data of Hafner et al. (2010). These are likely to be functional hsa-miR-124-3p target sites. We inserted these sites in-frame, in their native sequence context, at the end of the Renilla-encoding coding region of the dual luciferase psiCHECK2 vector. We also constructed variants of these constructs that contained mutations in the miRNA seed-complementary region (see Supplemental Methods and Supplemental Fig. 16). We then estimated the protein expression change (through luciferase assays) and the mRNA expression change (by qPCR) 24 h after the induction of hsa-miR-124 expression. As shown in Supplemental Figure 17, wild-type constructs exhibit a reduction in protein expression relative to the mutant constructs that cannot be explained by a corresponding decrease in mRNA levels. Thus, in human, mouse and zebrafish, CDS-located miRNA binding sites appear to be more effective in translational inhibition than in mRNA degradation.

387 Discussion
388 In spite of much research, the mechanisms of action and the function of miRNAs are insufficiently understood. An aspect that is still highly debated is whether miRNAs inhibit translation, induce mRNA degradation, or both. Recent high-throughput studies concluded that the reduction in protein levels upon miRNA expression is largely a consequence of the mRNA degradation induced by miRNAs (Baek et al. 2008; Selbach et al. 2008; Guo et al. 2010), though these initial experiments may have missed an important kinetic aspect (Bazzini et al. 2012). Another recurrent finding is that changes in target mRNA level upon miRNA transfection or overexpression are small. How these small effects can confer a selective advantage that is reflected in the strong evolutionary conservation of the target sites remains a puzzle. This applies especially to target sites located in coding regions, whose effects appear to be substantially smaller compared with those in 3' UTRs (Gu et al. 2009; Hafner et al. 2010; Schnall-Levin et al. 2010, 2011; Fang and Rajewsky 2011). What then could the function of miRNA-complementary CDS sites be?
389 Through an appropriate choice of a background set of sequences, the ElMMo model that we previously developed (Gaidatzis et al. 2007) allows us to predict miRNA binding sites in regions other than 3' UTRs. We thus predicted miRNA binding sites in CDS and used them to comparatively investigate the properties and effects of miRNA-complementary sites that are located in the coding domain or in the 3' UTR. We found that the sites that are effective at various steps of the miRNA-induced cascade are under evolutionary selection pressure. Furthermore, properties that we previously found to characterize functional 3' UTR sites also characterize the functional CDS sites. These findings suggest that CDS and 3' UTR sites function through similar mechanisms and have a comparable impact on gene expression.
390 Simultaneous measurement of mRNA and protein levels is nontrivial for a variety of reasons. Obtaining a good coverage of the proteome is difficult. Furthermore, proteomics measurements require that the proteins are labeled and this imposes constraints on the timing of miRNA transfection (or induction of expression). Sequencing of ribosome-protected fragments (rpf) circumvents some of these problems. For the first time, our analysis of such data reveals an effect that CDS-located miRNA binding sites are capable of inducing more effectively than 3' UTR-located sites, namely a rapid reduction in mRNA translation. In some of the data sets, the effect appears to be transient. Why on longer time scales the reduction in rpf can be largely explained by the reduction of the mRNA level is at the moment unclear. Some experiments involve miRNA transfection, which is transient by nature. However, the dre-miR-430 miRNA in zebrafish persists beyond 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) when the translation inhibition is apparently relieved. Thus, transient expression of the miRNA is probably not an explanation in this case, although it cannot be entirely ruled out because dre-miR-430 may be displaced from the RNA-induced silencing complex by other miRNAs at later time points.
391 Interestingly, in both the zebrafish system and our reporter system, some mRNAs with miRNA binding sites in coding regions appear to be up-regulated upon miRNA expression. This may reflect another unsuspected complexity of the kinetics of miRNA-dependent gene regulation (Bazzini et al. 2012; B�thune et al. 2012; Djuranovic et al. 2012). In zebrafish, one could hypothesize that the abundance of polyadenylated mRNAs, which are isolated for mRNA expression profiling, differs between Dicer-deficient and wild-type embryos. It is well known that polyadenylation is a common means of regulation of mRNA stability and translation (Telford et al. 1990; Audic et al. 1997; Henrion et al. 2000), with deadenylation being reported to be sufficient for mRNA degradation (Audic et al. 1997). In the Bazzini et al. (2012) data, however, what is observed is preferential stabilization of known dre-miR-430 targets, which suggests either a direct involvement of miRNA-dependent regulation or an indirect correlation caused by the overlap between the set of mRNAs that undergo polyadenylation changes in development and the set of dre-miR-430 targets. At this point it is difficult to imagine how miRNAs would be directly involved. miRNAs have been reported to induce deadenylation, particularly miR-430 during maternal-zygotic transition in zebrafish (Giraldez et al. 2006). However, at 2 hpf there should be no difference in the mRNA level of miR-430 targets in Dicer-deficient and wild-type cells, both of which lack miR-430. In Xenopus, it has been reported that siRNAs impair the accumulation of the embryonically expressed miR-427, restricting RNAi during early development (Lund et al. 2011). If this effect were present in zebrafish as well and the efficiency of the siRNAs were enhanced in Dicer-negative cells, it could contribute to the observed stabilization of miR-430 targets at 2 hpf. These considerations, however, do not apply to our reporter system. Because the effect appears to be reporter-specific, additional interplays with other regulators of mRNA stability and translation rate may be at work. A few examples of crosstalk between RNA-binding proteins and the miRNA pathway have been described (Bhattacharyya et al. 2006; Kedde et al. 2007; Kedde and Agami 2008; Kim et al. 2009) and more are likely to emerge in the future.
392 Finally, different families of miRNAs that are broadly expressed but are active in different contexts show distinct preferences for the CDS or 3' UTR. On one side of the spectrum are miRNAs expressed in the embryonic cells and miRNAs of the miR-17-92 cluster, that target predominantly 3' UTRs, but also show the strongest enrichment in CDS�3' UTR co-targeting. This suggests that these miRNAs strongly and robustly down-regulate target genes, for example at developmental transitions. On the other side of the spectrum are miRNAs of the miR-16 family, which have been previously shown to regulate cell cycle (Linsley et al. 2007). These miRNAs appear to preferentially bind to CDS-located sites, which we found to be effective in rapid inhibition of translation. This type of response may be better suited on the time scale of the cell cycle. Future work will determine the magnitude and timing of gene repression induced by miRNAs binding to the coding regions to uncover new aspects of miRNA biology.

395 Methods
396 Estimation of the selection pressure on CDS and 3' UTR target sites
397 In a previous study, we introduced the ElMMo model for inferring miRNA target sites based on comparative genomics data (Gaidatzis et al. 2007). ElMMo is parameter-free, requiring only a set of miRNA-complementary, putative sites in a reference species and pairwise genome alignments between the reference species and other species. We only considered regions that were complementary to positions 1�7, 2�8, or 1�8 of the miRNA as putative miRNA binding sites. Thus, miRNAs which are identical at positions 1�8 defined a miRNA family whose members have indistinguishable target sites according to our model. ElMMo predicts miRNA target site by estimating the selection pressure on motifs that are complementary to specific miRNAs, relative to a �background� set of motifs that do not correspond to miRNAs. By simply changing the type of sequences in the input data set (coding regions or 3' UTRs), ElMMo thus allows us to independently estimate the selection pressure on binding sites for individual miRNAs in CDS and 3' UTRs, respectively. We used human as the reference species, and the RefSeq data set of human transcripts downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) as the set of transcripts in which we predicted target sites.
398 Processing of quantitative proteomics, microarrays, and deep sequencing data
399 mRNA sequences, gene to mRNA mappings, mRNA to protein mappings, representative mRNA
400 We used the RefSeq mRNA database that we downloaded from NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) on Jan 18th 2011 for all analyses described in this manuscript. The Entrez database provides us with mappings of mRNAs-to-genes and protein-to-genes. For each gene, we defined a representative mRNA as the longest mRNA in RefSeq featuring 5' UTR, coding domain, and 3' UTR annotation.
401 Computational analysis of quantitative proteomics and microarray data
402 We followed the methods previously described in Hausser et al. (2009), except for minor changes in the analysis pipeline and for the use of updated genomic, mRNA, and protein sequence databases. The corresponding methods are described in the Supplemental Material.
403 Computational analysis of ribosome protected fragment sequencing and mRNA profiling data from Guo et al. (2010)
404 Guo et al. (2010) analyzed mRNAs and ribosome-protected fragments (rpf) in HeLa cells that were mock-transfected or transfected with hsa-miR-1 or hsa-miR-155-5p. The deep sequencing data was downloaded from the Sequence Reads Archive (accession: GSE22004) and analyzed on the CLIPZ server (Khorshid et al. 2011). To obtain per-gene expression levels, we first computed the number of reads mapping to representative mRNAs (longest mRNA having annotated 5' UTR, CDS, and 3' UTR among those associated with the gene according to the Entrez Gene database of NCBI). The number of reads was subsequently normalized by the length of the CDS in the case of rpf samples, or the length of the representative mRNA in the case of the mRNA-seq samples. For the analysis, we only considered 10,222 genes with nonzero expression levels in all experimental conditions (mock, hsa-miR-155-5p, and hsa-miR-1 transfections/mRNA and rpf sequencing/0, 12, and 32 h after transfection).
405 To investigate the effect of the transfected miRNAs on mRNA stability and translation, we first computed the log2 fold change in rpf and mRNA expression upon miRNA transfection compared with mock transfection. mRNAs were then divided into four subsets: those with no binding sites to the transfected miRNA, those with exactly one binding site located in the 3' UTR, those with exactly one binding site located in the CDS, and mRNAs with two binding sites in the CDS. Binding sites were defined as canonical seed matches�7mer-A1, 7mer-m8, 8mer (Bartel 2009). The overall effect of the transfected miRNA on rpf and mRNA levels was estimated by subtracting the log2 fold change of mRNAs without binding sites from that of mRNAs with binding sites (defined as above). Finally, the log2 fold change in translation induced by the transfected miRNAs was estimated from the difference between the log2 fold changes in rpf and mRNA levels.
406 EIF2C2 CLIP from Kishore et al. (2011)
407 We started from the raw CLIP and mRNA-seq reads (deposited in NCBI GEO under the accession GSE28865) of the 6 EIF2C2 CLIP experiments performed by Kishore et al. (2011). CLIP and mRNA-seq data were processed on the CLIPZ server (Khorshid et al. 2011). Only reads annotated as mRNA, mapping to a single genomic locus and to a single representative mRNA were used. CLIPed sites were defined as nonoverlapping 40-nt windows. For each mRNA, the first window was centered on the position of the mRNA that accumulated most reads. Additional windows were extracted similarly, under the constraint that they did not overlap with any previously extracted window. For each window, we computed the posterior probability that the number of CLIP reads associated to the window was larger than expected in a statistical model that only takes mRNA abundance into account (see �mRNA site extraction from CLIP reads� below). Finally, we determined which miRNA was most likely to be bound to the window by searching for 2�8 seed matches to the top 10 miRNA families expressed in HEK293 cells. In case several miRNAs mapped to a binding site, the site was assigned to most highly expressed miRNA. HEK293 miRNA profiles were determined from the two mild MNase digestion EIF2C2 CLIP samples of Kishore et al. (2011), using the methodology described in that paper.
408 mRNA site extraction from the EIF2C2 CLIP experiments of Kishore et al. (2011)
409 Outline of the statistical model
410 For each of the c sites yielded by the CLIP experiment, we compare the observed number of CLIP reads ri with the number of reads expected under a background model in which the number of reads per CLIP site depends only on the abundance of the corresponding mRNA. We neglect biases related to sequence accessibility, sequence composition, etc. Instead, we will focus on how CLIP sites located on mRNAs of different abundance are sampled in a thought experiment in which all CLIP sites are equally prone to bind the RNA-binding protein of interest and generate reads.
411 Estimating mRNA frequencies from mRNAseq data
412 Let us assume there are m genes, expressing different mRNAs. Although a gene typically expresses multiple mRNA isoforms, we assume for simplicity that each gene is represented by a single mRNA, defined as the longest isoform with 5' UTR, CDS, and 3' UTR that we find in the RefSeq database of NCBI. Thus, having m genes represented by m mRNAs, we would like to compute the probability that mRNA mi has relative abundance fi from the number of reads ni corresponding to mRNA mi that we observe in a sample.
413 If n is the total number of mRNA-seq reads and qi is the (unknown) probability that a read comes from mRNA mi, then the number of mRNA-seq reads that map to mRNA mi can be modeled to follow a binomial distribution:
414 Formula
415 Using Bayes's theorem, we can now compute the probability of qi:
416 Formula
417 Assuming a uniform prior on qi, we obtain
418 Formula
419 Setting a = ni + 1 and � = n - ni + 1 and using the beta function to compute the denominator yields the distribution on the probability qi for a read to come from mRNA mi:
420 Formula
421 where n is total number of mRNA-seq reads and ni is the number of reads mapping to mRNA mi.
422 The probability qi to obtain reads from mRNA mi is proportional to both the relative abundance fi of mRNA mi, and the length li of mRNA mi. Therefore,
423 Formula
424 where Z is a normalizing constant Graphic. If the number of distinct mRNAs m is large and if the relative abundance of mRNAs is independent of their length, then on average, we can make the following approximation:
425 Formula
426 What we are interested in is the relative abundance of mRNA mi, P(fi) and to obtain it, we start from
427 Formula
428 and perform a change of variable Graphic, i.e., Graphic which gives
429 Formula
430 This further yields
431 Formula
432 Finally, one can compute the expected relative abundance <fi> of mRNA mi from the expected value of a beta distribution,
433 Formula
434 which gives
435 Formula
436 Similarly, the deviation around the expected value <fi> can be obtained from the following fundamental property of the beta distribution:

438 Since Graphic, the standard deviation around the expected value <fi> becomes
439 Formula
440 or, in the limit of a large n,
441 Formula
442 The number n of reads mapping to mRNA is typically in the order of 106, with <1% of these reads mapping to the single most abundant mRNA. As a result, Graphic is <10-4.
443 Computing the distribution of the number of reads that is expected to fall into CLIP sites based on the abundance of the mRNA in the mRNA-seq data
444 Let r be the total number of reads produced by the CLIP experiment, ri of which map to CLIP site i, and let �(i) be the mRNA on which CLIP site i is located. Let c be the number of CLIP sites observed in the experiment. Because we only sample a finite number of reads, CLIP sites compete with each other for yielding sequenced reads. In our thought experiment, all CLIP sites are equally prone to be bound by the RNA-binding protein of interest and generate reads. This implies that CLIP sites are sampled according to the abundance of the mRNAs on which they reside. In that case, the probability that a read maps to CLIP site i is Graphic, where Q is the normalizing constant Graphic.
445 And so, we can write the distribution of the number of reads ri for site i as
446 Formula
447 However, we do not know the relative mRNA abundance f�(i), only its distribution P(f�(i)). Ideally, we would like to integrate f�(i) out to compute
448 Formula
449 with
450 Formula
451 Since this integral cannot be solved analytically, we make the approximation that all the probability density is concentrated at <f�(i)>. Because mRNA-seq libraries are typically large (n > 106) compared with the number of genes (m < 25,000), and because the single most abundant mRNA usually represents <1% of the total mRNA pool, this is a reasonable approximation to make, as shown by Equation 2 and illustrated by Supplemental Figure 18. Approximating P(f�(i)) by its expected value Graphic (see Equation 1) as opposed to the maximum likelihood estimate Graphic has the advantage that the relative abundance of any mRNA is always nonzero. This makes it possible to compute a probability of enrichment using a simple formula, even for sites located on mRNAs with no mRNAseq reads, as we will show now.
452 The expected value approximation of P(f�(i)) yields
453 Formula
454 where Graphic (see Equation 1) and Graphic.
455 Finally, substituting Graphic back in Equation 3 leads to
456 Formula
457 with
458 Formula
459 Ranking and selecting significantly enriched CLIP sites
460 We use the probabilistic model of Equation 4 as the basis for testing whether site i is significantly enriched over the expected number of CLIP read given the abundance of mRNA �(i).
461 Let ? be the fraction of the r CLIP reads that map to site i. Note that this fraction ? is unknown, but can be estimated from the number of CLIP reads ri mapping to site i. Under the H0 hypothesis that the site i is not enriched compared with what is expected given the abundance of the mRNA �(i), we would have ? = pi, pi being the fraction of CLIP reads expected to map to site i given the abundance of mRNA �(i). In contrast, under the H1 hypothesis that the site i is significantly enriched over the number of reads expected from the abundance of mRNA �(i) alone, we would have ? > pi. Note that P(H0) + P(H1) = 1.
462 Using Bayes's theorem, we can compute the posterior probability of H1 from
463 Formula
464 Formula
465 Formula
466 where we assumed that both hypotheses H0 and H1 have equal prior probability P(H0) = P(H1). P(ri|r, H1) can be obtained from the likelihood function introduced in Equation 4:
467 Formula
468 Formula
469 Formula
470 assuming a uniform prior on ? (P(?) = 1, ?? ? [0, 1]). By applying the same reasoning to P(ri|r, H0), one can show the denominator of Equation 7 to be
471 Formula(11)
472 Finally, substituting Equations 10 and 11 into Equation 7 gives a simple expression for the posterior probability P(H1|r, ri) that the number of CLIP reads ri mapping to site i is larger than what would be expected given the abundance of the mRNA alone:
473 Formula
474 which is the reverse cumulative probability of a Beta distribution.
475 To obtain binding sites, 40-nt windows are ranked by decreasing posterior probability first, and in the case of ties, by decreasing enrichment ratios Graphic.
476 Extraction of functional and nonfunctional miRNA binding sites
477 Data sets used in the analysis
478 The microarray and deep-sequencing data for the following references were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under the accessions GSE6838 and GSE8501 for Linsley et al. (2007), GSE14537 for Hausser et al. (2009), GSE11968 for Baek et al. (2008), GDS1858 for Grimson et al. (2007), GSE22004 for Guo et al. (2010), and GSE28865 for Kishore et al. (2011). The microarray data from Selbach et al. (2008) were downloaded from http://psilac.mdc-berlin.de/download/. Protein profiling data from Selbach et al. (2008) and Baek et al. (2008) were retrieved from http://psilac.mdc-berlin.de/download/ and http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature07242, respectively. Finally, predictions of miRNA binding sites under selection pressure are available as flat files from http://www.mirz.unibas.ch/miRNAtargetPredictionBulk.php.
479 Extraction of functional and nonfunctional miRNA binding sites from combined miRNA perturbation and microarray experiments
480 Among the mRNA profiling data sets that we reanalyzed, the experiments performed by Grimson et al. (2007), Baek et al. (2008), Selbach et al. (2008), and Guo et al. (2010) did not feature biological replicates. For these data sets, we considered the top 250 down-regulated mRNAs that carried precisely one canonical seed match (7mer-A1, 7mer-m8, or 8mer [Bartel 2009]) to the transfected miRNA. After discarding mRNAs with seed matches located in the 5' UTRs, we ended up with a set of �positive� (functional in mRNA down-regulation) seed matches. The negatives were obtained from the 250 mRNAs whose log2 expression fold changes were closest to 0 when comparing the miRNA-transfected samples to the mock-transfected samples. After discarding all seed matches located in the 5' UTRs, we ended up with a set of �negative� seed matches.
481 For the experiments performed by Karginov et al. (2007), Linsley et al. (2007), and Hausser et al. (2009), which featured biological replicates, we applied a method that we designed for selecting transcripts that, with high probability, are affected in expression by the miRNA across all experiments in which the expression of the given miRNA was perturbed. The method was described previously (see the Supplemental Material of Hausser et al. 2009). Briefly, we first calculated, for each pairwise microarray comparison (referred to as contrast) k, the probability Pk(f | -) that a transcript that is not a target will have a log fold change of f. To estimate the distributions Pk(f | -) we assumed that they are Gaussian with means �k and standard deviation sk. Further assuming that transcripts that do not carry at least a heptameric seed-complementary site are unlikely to be real targets, we estimated �k and sk from the observed expression changes of transcripts without such seed matches. We similarly calculated, for each contrast k, a distribution Pk(f | +) that a transcript which is a true target of the miRNA will have a fold change f. Not knowing the distribution of the severity of the effect that miRNAs have on the expression of their targets we assumed as little as possible about the distribution Pk(f | +), namely that a true target must change expression in the right direction, i.e., f < 0 for a miRNA overexpression experiment, and that expression changes are limited to a finite range over which the expression change has a �uniform� distribution. Finally, based on these distributions, we estimated the posterior probability that a transcript with fold change f was a functional target in a given experiment.
482 To obtain nonfunctional binding sites, we selected those transcripts with the smallest sum of squared log2 fold changes in the biological replicates. Finally, for the purpose of comparing the properties of functional and nonfunctional sites, we proceeded as with experiments where no replicates were performed: We selected 250 functional sites and 250 nonfunctional sites according to the criteria defined above and we discarded those cases in which the seed match was in the 5' UTR.
483 Extraction of functional and nonfunctional sites from ElMMo predictions
484 From our predictions of miRNA target sites under evolutionary selection (Gaidatzis et al. 2007) and for each of the experimentally tested and evolutionarily conserved miRNAs (hsa-miR-30a-5p, hsa-let-7c, hsa-miR-155-5p, hsa-miR-1, hsa-miR-103-3p, hsa-miR-15a-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-106b-5p, hsa-miR-20a-5p, hsa-miR-141-3p, hsa-miR-200a-3p, hsa-miR-181a-5p, hsa-miR-124-3p and hsa-miR-17-5p), we selected the top 250 target sites in the order of their posterior probability of being under selection. We also selected an equal number of sites least likely to be under selection, i.e., that had the smallest posterior probability of being under selection. This procedure was applied to the 3' UTR and CDS ElMMo miRNA target site predictions separately.
485 Extraction of functional and nonfunctional sites from CLIP experiments of Kishore et al. (2011)
486 The 40-nt windows were sorted by decreasing posterior probability, and, in the case of ties, by decreasing enrichment in CLIP reads (see �mRNA site extraction from EIF2C2 CLIP experiments� in Methods). We only kept windows with exactly one canonical seed match (7mer-U1, 7mer-m8, or 8mer [Bartel 2009]) to one of the top 10 expressed miRNA families in HEK293 cells. These top 10 families were determined from reads mapping to miRNAs in the EIF2C2 MNase CLIP experiments, as described in Kishore et al. (2011) and were hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-miR-103-3p, hsa-miR-106a-5p, hsa-miR-10a-5p, hsa-miR-15a-5p, hsa-miR-19a-3p, hsa-miR-25-3p, hsa-miR-30a-5p, hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-7-5p. Functional 3' UTR binding sites were obtained from the top 250 windows located in the 3' UTR while nonfunctional miRNA binding sites were defined as the 250 windows with weakest enrichment. Finally, CDS binding sites were obtained in a similar fashion from windows located in coding domains.
487 Properties definition and computation
488 For data sets in which the effect could not be unambiguously attributed to a single site (all data sets other than those derived by CLIP and comparative genomic analysis), we only analyzed mRNAs that had precisely one canonical miRNA seed match (7mer-A1, 7mer-m8, or 8mer). In addition, we only considered sites that were at least 100 nt away from the 5' and 3' ends of the mRNA. For each individual putative target site we then computed 32 sequence and structure properties, described in detail in the Supplemental Methods and Hausser et al. (2009).
489 Enrichments in the number of genes co-targeted in the CDS and in the 3' UTR
490 To determine whether individual miRNAs tend to target the same genes in the CDS and in the 3' UTR more than expected by chance, we determined, for each miRNA, the number c11 of genes containing at least one of the top 250 CDS and at least one of the 250 top 3' UTR binding sites predicted by ElMMo. These numbers are reported in the �genes targeted both in CDS and 3' UTR� column of Supplemental Table 2. In addition, we also determined the number c10 of genes containing at least one of the top 250 CDS binding sites, but not any of the 250 predicted 3' UTR binding sites. Similarly, we determined the number c01 of genes containing at least one of the top 250 predicted 3' UTR binding sites but none of the top 250 predicted CDS binding sites.
491 Under the hypothesis that miRNAs target the CDS and 3' UTR independently, we expect a fraction Graphic of all mRNAs to be co-targeted in the CDS and in the 3' UTR, where n = 18,430 is the number of representative mRNAs used in the analysis. We define the fold enrichment in the number of co-targeted mRNAs as the ratio between the observed fraction of co-targeted mRNAs Graphic and the expected fraction of co-targeted mRNAs under the model that miRNAs independently target the CDS and the 3' UTR Graphic. The �co-targeting fold enrichment� reported in Supplemental Table 2 is defined as
492 Formula
493 and we use Fisher's test to assess whether the obtained ratio is significantly different from 1. The Bonferroni-corrected P-values are reported in the last column of Supplemental Table 2.
494 Statistical evidence that CDS and 3' UTR co-targeting occurs mostly for miRNAs that preferentially target 3' UTRs
495 To test for a statistical link between the tendency of individual miRNAs to co-target the CDS and 3' UTRs of the same mRNAs and their preference for CDS vs. 3' UTR targeting, we first selected n = 62 miRNAs that showed significant enrichment in the number of co-targeted mRNAs, as described in the previous section. These miRNAs had an average excess of � = 585.7 predicted binding sites in the 3' UTR. From the standard deviation s = 589.5 between the individual 62 miRNAs, we can compute a Z-score for the tendency of these miRNAs to preferentially target 3' UTRs:
496 Formula
497 which indicates a strong preference for 3' UTR targeting. Further assuming that the preferences for CDS vs. 3' UTR targeting are Gaussian distributed, we can compute the P-value (P < 10-15) that miRNAs that co-target mRNAs in the CDS and in the 3' UTR are mostly found among miRNAs that preferentially target 3' UTRs.

598 Abstract
599 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that play important roles in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. Mature miRNAs associate with the RNA interference silencing complex to repress mRNA translation and/or degrade mRNA transcripts. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has enabled identification of several core components of the canonical miRNA processing pathway and their posttranslational modifications which are pivotal in miRNA regulatory mechanisms. The use of quantitative proteomic strategies has also emerged as a key technique for experimental identification of miRNA targets by allowing direct determination of proteins whose levels are altered because of translational suppression. This review focuses on the role of proteomics and labeling strategies to understand miRNA biology.

602 1 Background
603 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs of about 22 nucleotides that regulate various cellular functions such as differentiation [1], metabolism [2], senescence [3], autophagy [4], proliferation, and apoptosis [5]. miRNAs impose this layer of posttranscriptional gene regulation on a wide spectrum of biological processes ranging from gametogenesis [6], development [7], and tissue repair [8] to aging [9]. This widespread regulation reflected in the fact that up to ~60% of the human protein-coding genes are potentially modulated by miRNAs [10]. Given the extensive involvement of miRNA in physiology, dysregulation of miRNA expression can be associated with cancer pathobiology including oncogenesis [11], proliferation [12], epithelial-mesenchymal transition [13], metastasis [14], aberrations in metabolism [15], and angiogenesis [16], among others. To date, the online miRNA repository database, miRBase (Release 18), has documented over 2000 human mature miRNA sequences and over 1200 mouse mature miRNA sequences along with miRNAs reported in other organisms [17]. With the availability of next generation sequencing technologies, this list will undoubtedly continue to expand further [18].
604 In general, genes encoding miRNAs are initially transcribed as primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II, and then pri-miRNAs are processed to be precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by the microprocessor complex comprising of Drosha and DGCR8 [19]. The pre-miRNAs, hairpin-like structures of ~60–80 nucleotides, are transported to the cytosol by exportin-5 [20], where they are processed by Dicer in association with TRBP to form ~22-nucleotide double stranded mature miRNAs (Fig. 1) [21]. In parallel, the mature miRNAs are assembled with the RNA interference silencing complex (RISC) comprising of Argonaute and TNRC6 (GW182 protein) [22]. The assembly process also involves the chaperones Hsc70/Hsp90 and ATP [23]. The mature miRNA consists of two strands – a passenger strand which is degraded and a functional guide strand which pairs with its cognate mRNA (target) mostly in the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) by complementary-base pairing [24]. Binding of miRNAs to their cognate target mRNAs results in translation repression and/or mRNA destabilization by either decapping target mRNAs or by deadenylation followed by mRNA degradation [25].

608 The vast majority of studies on miRNA biology thus far have primarily focused on two aspects: elucidating mechanisms of miRNA-mediated posttranscriptional gene regulation and identifying targets of miRNAs. This has been made possible by the use of established methodologies such as gene expression microarrays, next generation sequencing, computational prediction of miRNA targets, and mass spectrometry-based proteomic approaches [26]. Each of these high-throughput technologies has its own advantages, thus complementing one another. In this article, we will highlight the importance and advantages of proteomics to decipher the role of miRNA in regulating biological processes.

610 2 Approaches for computational analysis and proteomics
611 2.1 Computational approaches to predict miRNA targets
612 A large majority of reports describing identification of miRNA targets are based on computational approaches or detection of altered mRNA levels. However, the mechanism of target recognition is still not fully understood and as a result the algorithms that are employed for target gene prediction are not accurate and often overpredict miRNA targets. Numerous web-based miRNA target prediction tools such as TargetScan (www.targetscan.org), miRanda (www.microrna.org), TarBase (diana.cslab.ece.ntua.gr), PicTar (pictar.mdcberlin.de), RNA22 (cbcsrv.watson.ibm.com/rna22.html), mirWIP (ambroslab.org), PITA (genie.weizmann.ac.il/pubs/mir07/mir07_dyn_data.html), and miRDB (mirdb.org) predict miRNA targets based on selection criteria such as sequence pairing (which involves perfect or nearly perfect complementarity between nucleotides 2 and 8 at the 5′ end of miRNA (seed sequence) to the mRNA target site), secondary structure modeling, free energy calculation, and comparative genomic sequence conservation. However, the field is greatly expanding with significant improvements in technologies resulting in the generation of a vast amount of data. Furthermore, most prediction tools overlook the potentiality of miRNA binding in 5′UTR region as well as the coding sequence, even though there is substantial evidence provided by several groups [27–29]. Thus, it should be noted that miRNA target prediction by computational methods alone is not sufficient and it becomes essential to experimentally identify and validate targets of miRNAs.
613 2.2 Importance of proteomics in understanding miRNA biology
614 One of the mechanisms by which miRNA regulates gene expression is by repressing translation without mRNA degradation [30,31]. Determining the mRNA expression levels is not ideal for identifying targets as mRNA levels do not necessarily correlate with the levels of protein expression [32–34]. In addition, the discordance between half-lives of mRNAs and proteins adds another layer of complexity in drawing conclusions about the proteome from analysis of the transcriptome. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that the efficiency of miRNA-mediated gene silencing can be downregulated by poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation of Argonaute/RISC, suggesting that the mere presence of miRNA does not necessarily reduce the protein production [35]. Therefore, the abundance of mRNA/miRNA species does not serve as the best surrogate marker for biological activity of these proteins. This problem can be alleviated by the use of mass-spectrometry-based proteomic approaches that enable studying the protein complement of cells more directly.
615 2.3 Mass spectrometry as a discovery tool
616 The dynamic nature and complexity of the proteome present enormous technological challenges. Mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technology that enables elucidation of protein sequence as well as abundance. Recent advances in mass spectrometry have significantly enhanced the throughput of protein identification and quantification by improved sensitivity, high resolving power, reproducibility, and the dynamic range of proteomic analyses. A typical proteomic experiment involves isolation and extraction of proteins from cells or tissues, protease digestion to generate peptides generally followed by sample fractionation to reduce proteome complexity. The fractionated samples are then introduced into a mass spectrometer where the peptides are ionized and their masses measured. The peptide ions are then picked for fragmentation in a data-dependent fashion leading to generation of MS/MS spectra. Improved separation methods are essential for increasing the comprehensiveness and throughput of proteome analyses and to address the complexity of proteomes.
617 2.4 Proteomic strategies in miRNA research
618 Over the past decade, various strategies have been developed and optimized to characterize the proteome. A large majority of proteomic experiments in miRNA research have employed mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic approaches. Quantitative proteomics has emerged as a promising tool to identify proteins differentially expressed in various biological processes [36]. To enable protein quantitation, two main strategies are currently employed by the community in combination with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1). These are referred as “label” and “label free” strategies. Labeling techniques utilize isotopic labels as a reference for either relative or absolute quantitation. These labels can be introduced in vivo by labeling methods such as SILAC [37] or by in vitro labeling strategies such as iTRAQ [38], 18O labeling [39] or TMT tags [40], among others. Apart from labeling-based methods, a semiquantitative strategy, less frequently used, is based on differential spot analysis by two-dimensional electrophoresis [41–43].
619 In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development and application of technologies for targeted analysis of peptides in complex protein samples. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) or multiple reaction monitoring is a robust tandem mass spectrometry method employed to monitor these protein-specific peptides and thus provide quantitative measurements [44,45]. SRM assays allow identification and quantitation of peptides with very low limits of detection, high reproducibility, specificity, and sensitivity. In contrast to discovery-type proteomic experiments, SRM assays allow one to perform repeat measurements with high-throughput and sensitivity. Several groups have employed labeling strategies to identify targets of miRNAs. However, to date there are only two studies (both by the same group) where SRM-based targeted studies were performed to identify and validate predicted targets in C. elegans [46, 47].
620 Non-MS-based proteomic approaches such as reverse phase protein microarray have also been employed to study various biological processes. These include profiling immune response to infection, protein–protein interactions, protein–nucleic acid interactions and signaling pathways and have also been utilized to understand the mechanism of miRNA regulation. In a recent study, Iliopoulos et al. carried out microRNA profiling and reverse-phase protein microarray analysis on the same patient-derived osteoarthritic cartilage to identify genes involved in osteoarthritic pathogenesis. Integrating the data from both these approaches together with the use of miRNA prediction algorithms, they created an interactome network and uniquely identified 17 miRNA-gene target pairs implicated in pathogenesis of osteoarthritis [48].

622 3 Application of proteomics in miRNA research
623 The power of MS-based proteomics has been exploited to identify several critical components of the miRNA biogenesis pathway and their posttranslational modifications. Additionally, quantitative proteomic strategies have facilitated quantifying proteomic changes secondary to the perturbation of certain miRNAs. This confers a powerful high throughput platform to predict miRNA targets that are not fully appreciated by bioinformatics tools. These aspects will be covered in the following sections.
624 3.1 Identification of key components in miRNA biogenesis
625 MS-based proteomics has enabled identification of several associating factors such as DGCR8, TRBP, and TNRC6 that are all indispensable for generating miRNAs. Gregory et al. immunoprecipitated Drosha in HEK293T cells, identifying DGCR8 as the co-eluate in the complex that decisively retained the pri-miRNA processing activity [19]. Analyzing Dicer affinity eluates through mass spectrometry, Chendrimada et al. identified TRBP, a protein necessary for the functional interaction between Dicer and Argonaute. They observed diminished generation of mature miRNA upon TRBP knockdown [21]. Using shotgun proteomic analysis, Duchaine et al. identified Dicer (DCR-1)-associated proteins in C. elegans using immunoaffinity purification approach. They identified a high confidence set of 20 interactors, many of which were previously not known to interact with DCR-1. Interaction between Dicer and the translation initiation factor, EIF2C2, has partially unveiled the mechanism of miRNA-mediated translation suppression [49]. Association between Argonaute and TNRC6 was initially revealed through multidimensional protein identification technology by Liu et al. and supported by several other groups' finding [50–53]. Identification of these core factors of miRNA processing pathways has initiated further functional and quantitative studies that will be discussed below. Wang et al. employed a quantitative proteomic approach to compare functions across different Argonaute proteins in mouse skin and human melanoma cells [54]. They employed spectral counting, a label-free quantitative method, to measure changes in the abundance of Ago1–4 in mouse skin cells. Their study showed that the abundance of Ago3/4 is negligible and the ratio between Ago1 and Ago2 is close to their associated miRNAs, an implication that miRNAs are loaded randomly onto Ago1 and Ago2.
626 3.2 Mapping posttranslational modifications on key components of miRNA biogenesis
627 The miRNA processing pathway is now known to be regulated by posttranslational modifications on key components such as Drosha, TRBP, and Argonaute. Importantly, these modifications such as phosphorylation and hydroxylation result in alteration of their activity that, in turn, influences miRNA biogenesis. To delineate the regulation of pri-miRNA processing, Tang et al. examined the mechanism by which Drosha, one of the key enzymes in the miRNA processing machinery, localizes to the nucleus. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed phosphorylation at Ser-300 or Ser-302 and with additional functional studies they proved that phosphorylation at either site is critical for nuclear localization [55]. Serine phosphorylation is also important for functions of TRBP and Argonaute. Paroo et al. have shown that Dicer complexes with phosphorylated TRBP to generate mature miRNAs in HeLa cells. They identified four serine residues (Ser-142, Ser-152, Ser-283, and Ser-286) phosphorylated by MAPK/Erk and unequivocally demonstrated that phosphorylated TRBP confers stability to the Dicer-TRBP complex [56]. Additionally, this study also revealed phosphorylation of Argonaute by MAPK-activated protein kinase 2. A study by Zeng et al. showed that phosphorylation of Ago-2 at Ser-387 mediates localization of Argonaute to processing bodies which are the site for the process of miRNA-mediated gene silencing [57]. Further, studies have shown that apart from phosphorylation at key residues, other modifications also play important roles in the functioning of Argonaute. Qi et al. studied the interactome of Argonaute with MS-based proteomics and have shown that it physically interacts with the subunits of prolyl-4-hydroxylase. They further demonstrated that hydroxylation at Pro-700 of Ago-2 is essential for its own stability and for miRNA-mediated gene silencing [58]. Overall, the regulation of the miRNA processing pathway by posttranslational modifications has been relatively less investigated and additional studies are required to reveal the intricate mechanism of miRNA processing.
628 3.3 Proteome analysis for suppression of miRNA processing pathways
629 Perturbation of miRNA processing pathway such as Dicer and Argonaute results in phenotypic changes; thus functional studies regarding these components are of prime interest. Dicer is one of the key enzymes of the miRNA processing machinery and is also known to play important roles in cell differentiation and apoptosis. Knockout of Dicer gene has been reported to cause various defects [59–62]. To investigate the functions of Dicer in vivo, our group generated SILAC mice to study the effects of inducible deletion of Dicer [63]. Our study showed abnormal lipid accumulation in small intestine. Evaluation of the proteomic changes in the small intestine revealed a critical role of Dicer in lipid transport [63]. In an episomal shRNA expression system, Drosha knockdown experiments in MCF-7 and HCT116 showed size-biased proteome modifications [42]. Similar quantitative proteomics strategies need to be employed in the future to increase our depth of understanding the components involved in the canonical and noncanonical miRNA processing pathways.
630 3.4 Identification of miRNA targets using quantitative proteomics
631 A complete delineation of the miRNA targeting mechanism entails concurrent measurement of mRNAs and their protein products. In the past few years, several groups have made significant efforts to integrate high-throughput techniques to enable identification of bona fide miRNA targets (Table 1). Most studies thus far have employed overexpression of the miRNAs of interest in a transient or stable fashion to identify potential targets. Other studies have employed anti-miRNA oligonucleotides and miRNA knockout mouse model. SILAC-based strategy has been widely used in most studies to identify miRNA targets [64–67]. Baek et al. measured the effects of addition of miRNAs such as miR-124, a brain specific miRNA, miR-1, and miR-181 on the expression levels of proteins in HeLa cells. Based on the identification of the repressed proteins, this study revealed that these miRNAs recognize seed sequences located within the 3′ UTRs. In addition, they also studied the effects of miRNA knockout to identify endogenous targets since ectopic addition of miRNAs would only provide insights into miRNA target recognition and potential targets [64]. Our group has also adopted SILAC-based strategy and knocked down expression of endogenous miR-21 to identify its potential targets [68]. This miRNA is known to play important roles in tumorigenesis. To enable identification and quantitation of proteins synthesis on a global scale, Ebner et al. devised a new strategy which is a variation of SILAC technology and designated it pulsed SILAC (pSILAC). pSILAC measures the differences in the amount of protein synthesized over a period of time depending upon the incorporation rate of heavy amino acids [66]. They applied this strategy to study the protein regulatory mechanisms by miRNAs. Kaller et al. employed pSILAC and microarray analysis to study the effects of miR-34a, an important mediator of p53-mediated tumor suppressor activities on mRNA and proteome expression [69]. Employing iTRAQ-based quantitative strategy coupled with computational prediction, Taguchi et al., identified hypoxia inducible factor-1α as a novel target of miR17–92 cluster in lung cancer cells. Overexpression of miR17–92 cluster has been shown to play important roles in lung cancer and in B-cell lymphoma development. Using an SRM-based approach, Jovanovic et al. quantified and validated predicted targets of let-7 and miR-58 in C. elegans. Their results revealed ztf-7 as a bona fide target of let-7 which was also supported by another independent study [46].

634 A list of publications that have employed quantitative proteomics to identify miRNA targets
635 In addition to identifying individual miRNA targets, the application of quantitative proteomics also reveals several signaling networks of cancer biology. Schliekelman et al. use SILAC to determine which proteins are regulated by miR-200 family to cause the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung cancer. Many of them are associated with TGFβ-1, a finding corroborating with the current understanding [70]. To decode the intricate network of Wnt signaling in carcinogenesis, Schepeler et al. took a two-step approach [71]. They first adopted a conditional suppression system of Wnt signaling and identified miR-145, miR-126, miR-30e-3p, and miR-139–5p as critical regulators for their ectopic expression causing growth inhibition. Subsequently, they used spectral counting to characterize proteomic changes and luciferase assays to confirm that PIK3C2A is related to aberrant Wnt signaling. Another network-revealing study about cancer biology was conducted by Cheng et al., who transfected miR-34a in a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. In the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis coupled with mass spectrometry, half of the differentially regulated proteins were found to be miR-34a targets and shown belong to p53 signaling pathway [43].
636 Although these studies have led to identification of many novel miRNA candidate targets, a clear distinction between direct and indirect targets is lacking. Studies have shown that identification of direct miRNA targets is possible by co immunoprecipitation of miRISCs with the associated mRNAs, which is then coupled to microarrays (RIP-Chip) or mRNA sequencing (CLIP-Seq). However, these approaches do not measure the protein expression level of the direct targets. Recently, Jovanovic et al. developed a targeted, quantitative proteomic approach called RIP-chip-SRM to identify direct targets of miRNAs. This combinatorial approach involves RIP-chip analysis of miRISC complexes isolated from wild-type and miRNA deletion mutants followed by SRM analysis to determine the abundance of the protein products of the candidate transcripts [47]. One noteworthy caveat of the immunoprecipitation-based study was recently observed by Riley et al., who showed that the association between Argonaute proteins and miRNAs can happen after cell lysis [72]. This points out the possibility of false positive results from this type of study.
637 3.5 Future perspective
638 The use of quantitative proteomic strategies to characterize targets of miRNAs has opened new avenues to study miRNA biology. More and more targets of important miRNAs that relate to cancers are being identified and helping us unravel the intricacies of cancers and potentially even develop novel anticancer approaches. Meanwhile, our knowledge of post-translational modifications on components of the miRNA processing pathway and their associated factors is also expanding, paving the road for more functional analysis of miRNA-mediated gene regulation. Much of this progress has been enabled by quantitative proteomics, and we envision that this trend will continue in miRNA research and accelerate in the years to come.

755 Summary
756 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are inhibitors of gene expression capable of controlling processes in normal development and cancer. In mammals, miRNAs use a seed sequence of 6–8 nucleotides (nt) to associate with 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) of mRNAs and inhibit their expression. Intriguingly, occasionally not only the miRNA-targeting site but also sequences in its vicinity are highly conserved throughout evolution. We therefore hypothesized that conserved regions in mRNAs may serve as docking platforms for modulators of miRNA activity. Here we demonstrate that the expression of dead end 1 (Dnd1), an evolutionary conserved RNA-binding protein (RBP), counteracts the function of several miRNAs in human cells and in primordial germ cells of zebrafish by binding mRNAs and prohibiting miRNAs from associating with their target sites. These effects of Dnd1 are mediated through uridine-rich regions present in the miRNA-targeted mRNAs. Thus, our data unravel a novel role of Dnd1 in protecting certain mRNAs from miRNA-mediated repression.

759 Introduction
760 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a family of ∼22 nucleotide (nt) RNAs widely expressed in metazoans (Lee et al., 1993 and Pillai et al., 2007). These regulators of gene expression are capable of defining and altering cell fate. Recent estimations suggest the existence of 500–1000 miRNAs per genome and that a large proportion of human protein-coding genes are under the regulation of one or more miRNAs (Aravin and Tuschl, 2005 and Lewis et al., 2005). Evidence suggests that miRNAs participate in the regulation of a large variety of cellular processes and that the vast majority of miRNAs show tissue or developmental stage-specific expression (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002, Lim et al., 2005 and Wienholds et al., 2005). Importantly, aberrant expression or activity of miRNAs can lead to disease (Kloosterman and Plasterk, 2006, Pillai et al., 2007 and Voorhoeve and Agami, 2006).
761 Most miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as long RNAs that are converted to ∼70-nt-long pre-miRNAs by Drosha (Lee et al., 2003). The pre-miRNAs are then exported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5, converted to ∼22 nt mature miRNAs by Dicer, and one strand of the duplex is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (Gregory et al., 2005 and Maniataki and Mourelatos, 2005). In animals, miRNAs utilize a seed sequence at their 5′ end (nt 2–8) to associate with 3′UTR regions of mRNAs to suppress gene expression by inhibiting translation that occasionally is associated with mRNA decay (Bagga et al., 2005, Lim et al., 2005 and Pillai et al., 2005). Repressed mRNAs, miRNAs, and most proteins constituting the miRNA-RISC complex (miRNP) are enriched in cytoplasmic processing bodies called P bodies. P bodies are known to be sites of translational repression and mRNA decay. They are enriched in factors involved in inhibition of translation and lack ribosomes and translation-initiation factors (Liu et al., 2005 and Pillai et al., 2005).
762 Importantly, it is becoming increasingly clear that during their biogenesis, the activity of miRNAs is subjected to intense regulation. For example, the nuclear processing of certain miRNAs (e.g., let-7 in ES cells) can be repressed by a yet unknown mechanism (Thomson et al., 2006). Furthermore, certain miRNAs are modified by RNA editing, a process that can lead to changes in miRNA stability or alter their target selection (Kawahara et al., 2007, Knight and Bass, 2002 and Yang et al., 2006). Additionally, two recent reports indicated that miRNA-mediated repression in neurons is reversible. Treatment of cultured rat neurons with brain-derived neurotrophic factor leads to partial relief of Limk1 mRNA repression by miRNA-134 (Schratt et al., 2006). This process possibly involves the mTOR pathway, although the mechanism of miRNA derepression remains unknown. Second, external stimulation of Drosophila olfactory neurons induces degradation of the Armitage protein, which is required for miRNP assembly ( Ashraf et al., 2006). As a result, the translation of the protein kinase CaMKII mRNA, which is controlled by miRNAs, is enhanced. Last, the repression of CAT-1 mRNA by miR-122 in hepatocarcinoma cells is relieved in stress conditions by binding of HuR, an AU-rich element-binding protein, to a region at the end of the 3′UTR of CAT-1 ( Bhattacharyya et al., 2006).
763 In addition, evidence in zebrafish suggests that, a subset of miR-430 targets is protected from repression in germ cells (Mishima et al., 2006). In particular, miR-430-mediated repression of nanos1 and TDRD7 is not effective in germ cells. As specific regions in the 3′UTR of these genes counteract their repression in germline cells, it is reasonable to assume that germ cell-specific factors bind and counteract miR-430 function in these cells. Germ cells are known to contain structures referred to as germ plasm that resemble P bodies; these contain an array of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) giving these cells unique control over translation and the stability of mRNA and proteins (Kotaja et al., 2006 and Kotaja and Sassone-Corsi, 2007). Together, these observations indicate that the miRNA pathway can be controlled at different levels, from stability, processing, sequence identity, and binding to target mRNAs. Here we show that the RBP dead end 1 (Dnd1) prohibits miRNA-dependent inhibition of gene expression in human cells and in zebrafish primordial germ cells.

765 Dnd1 Relieves miRNA Repression in Human Germline Cells
766 Using functional genetic-screening approaches, we have recently identified the miRNA-mRNA interactions between p27 and miR-221 and between LATS2 and miR-372 as promoting cancer (le Sage et al., 2007 and Voorhoeve et al., 2006). Both p27 and LATS2 harbor at their 3′UTR two nearby evolutionary conserved target sequences for miRNA-221 or -372, respectively, that are required and sufficient for miRNA function (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1B). Interestingly, in both cases the conservation was not restricted to the miRNA-targeting sequences, but rather included the whole region in between the two miRNA-targeting sites. This observation suggests that other factors (proteins or RNA) could associate with these regions to influence miRNA/mRNA function and/or interaction. To investigate the possibility that RBPs influence the activity of the miRNA pathway, we examined the effect of expression of several RBPs on miR-221-mediated repression of p27. We utilized a reporter assay with the wild-type 3′UTR of p27 coupled to luciferase and measured miRNA-induced repression. We found that human dead end 1 (Dnd1), a protein whose function is required for germ cell survival and migration in zebrafish (Weidinger et al., 2003), affects miRNA activity. Specifically, cotransfection of Dnd1 diminished miR-221-mediated inhibition of luciferase-p27-3′UTR expression (Figure 1B). Dnd1 had no effect on expression from either a construct encoding luciferase-p27 3′UTR that is mutated at the two miR-221 sites or on an empty luciferase reporter vector, suggesting that the increase in luciferase expression was not caused by a general effect on transcription or translation efficiency but rather was specific to miRNA-repressed translation. Similar results were obtained with LATS2/miR-372 and connexin-43/miR-1 and -206 (Figure S1C). To further test whether Dnd1 activity depends on miRNA function we inactivated miRNA synthesis with an shRNA vector targeting Pasha, a component specific to the miRNA pathway (Gregory et al., 2004). Figure S1D demonstrates the inhibitory effect of shPasha on miR-221 processing. In HEK293 cells, which endogenously express p27 and miR-221 (Figure 2C), introduction of Dnd1 or inhibition of Pasha, elevated endogenous p27 protein levels to a comparable extent (∼4-fold, Figure 1C). Interestingly, cointroduction of Dnd1 and shPasha did not cause further elevation in p27 levels, further supporting the idea that Dnd1 activity depends on miRNA function.

770 (A) Conservation analysis of p27-3′UTR from human to fish (from Kent et al. [2002]). The positions of the two target sequences of miR-221 are marked.
771 (B) Expression vectors for miR-221 and human Dnd1 (huDnd1) were cotransfected with the indicated luciferase constructs. Relative luciferase activity is the ratio between firefly luciferase and renilla control luciferase, adjusted to 100%. An immunostaining with anti-HA antibody demonstrates the expression of huDnd1 while H2B-GFP was used to control transfection efficiency. The results are represented as means and SD from three independent experiments.

786 Dnd1 contains a conserved RNA-binding domain that bears high similarity to that of apobec complementation factor (ACF), LOC166863, Syncrip, hnRNPR, ELAV4, and DAZ. To test whether the effect of Dnd1 on miRNA activity is specific and mediated through its RNA-binding domain, we used expression plasmids of Dnd1 homologs and related genes and found neither to significantly inhibit miR-221-mediated suppression of luciferase-p27 3′UTR (Figure 1D, expression controls shown in Figure S1E). In contrast, repression of miR-221 activity was observed also when the zebrafish and mouse homologs of Dnd1 were introduced (Figure 1E and data not shown). Interestingly, transfection of a zebrafish Dnd1 mutated at a single conserved residue within its RNA-binding domain (Y104C, a mutant that cannot rescue loss of germ cells when Dnd1 is depleted in zebrafish embryos; K.S and E.R., unpublished data) hampered Dnd1's ability to inhibit miR-221 function (Figure 1E). Also substituting the RNA-binding domain of Dnd1 for that of ACF resulted in loss of Dnd1 function (Figure S1F). Collectively, these results suggest that inhibiting miRNA function is specific to Dnd1 and indicate that for counteracting miRNA activity, Dnd1 requires an intact RNA-binding domain.
787 Suppression of gene expression by miRNAs is exerted by translational inhibition that occasionally is associated with mRNA decay (Bagga et al., 2005, Lim et al., 2005 and Pillai et al., 2005). To test the possible effect of Dnd1 on these pathways, we examined the endogenous p27 RNA and protein levels in HEK293 cells (expressing endogenous p27 and miR-221and -222, Figure 2C). Figure 1F shows that transfection of either human or wild-type zebrafish Dnd1, but not the Y104C mutant, caused elevation in p27 mRNA (up to 1.5-fold) and protein (up to 5-fold), indicating that Dnd1 can potently block endogenous miR-221 and -222-mediated mRNA decay and translation inhibition.
788 In all our experiments so far we examined the function of human Dnd1 by ectopic introduction. To study endogenous Dnd1 function, we first tested by quantitative RT-PCR several human cancer cell lines for the expression of Dnd1 and found the teratoma Tera1 cell line to be positive. Interestingly, Tera1 cells express high levels of the miR-372 family, which we have previously shown to target LATS2 through two sites at its 3′UTR (Figure S1B). We therefore examined endogenous LATS2 expression in Tera1 cells following suppression of Dnd1 expression by an effective shRNA vector (Figure S1G). As Dnd1 affected both miRNA-mediated translation inhibition and mRNA stability (Figure 1F), we used quantitative RT-PCR and found a marked reduction in LATS2 mRNA levels associated with the inhibition of endogenous Dnd1 expression (Figure 1G), suggesting that Dnd1 protects LATS2 expression. To directly measure the effect of endogenous Dnd1 on the activity of endogenous miR-372 family, we used sensor molecules containing the luciferase gene under the control of either wild-type LATS2-3′UTR or a mutant in the 372 target sites (le Sage et al., 2007 and Voorhoeve et al., 2006). Figure 1H shows that transfection of shDnd1, but not a control vector, reduced the expression of a cotransfected luciferase LATS2 3′UTR reporter gene only when the miR-372 targeting sites were present. Altogether, these results indicate that endogenous Dnd1 in Tera1 cells protects the expression of endogenous LATS2 from being targeted by the miR-372 family.
789 Preferential Association of Dnd1 with mRNAs
790 Since Dnd1 requires an intact RNA-binding domain to counteract miRNA function, it is conceivable that Dnd1 interferes with either the expression, the processing to mature miRNA, or the subcellular localization of miR-221. To examine the effects of Dnd1 on miR-221 biogenesis, MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with vectors encoding either human or zebrafish Dnd1 and miR-221 or control miRNA, and subsequently subjected to subcellular fractionation, RNA isolation, and to an RNase protection assay (RPA) to detect cyclophilin control RNA and miR-221 precursor and mature forms. As shown in Figure 2A, the expression level, efficiency of processing, or subcellular localization of mature miR-221 were not altered by Dnd1. Western blot analysis with anti-HA confirmed the expression of human and zebrafish proteins, whereas nuclear Cdc6 and cytoplasmic Tubulin verified cellular fractionation (Figure 2A, bottom).
791 An alternative explanation that could account for Dnd1 activity is that the protein binds miRNAs and inhibits their function. To test this option we converted one miR-221-targeting site in p27 3′UTR to an RNAi site (named FC, a full complementary region to miR-221) and mutated the seed of the second site ( Figure 2B). In this way, p27-3′UTR FC was solely subjected to RNAi-mediated degradation by miR-221. In cotransfection assays, the presence of Dnd1 did not reduce miR-221 activity toward p27-3′UTR FC, suggesting that Dnd1 was unable to counteract the RNAi pathway. These results are in line with the assumption that Dnd1 counteracts miR-221 activity either at the level of RISC-incorporated-mature miR-221 or downstream, rather than by steric hindrance of miR-221.
792 Next, we checked whether Dnd1 interacts with mature miR-221 or with p27 3′UTR. We transfected HEK293 cells with HA-tagged Dnd1, Dnd1Y104C, and as controls HA-tagged PAK4 and empty vector. We also cotransfected an expression vector for miR-221 to enhance the possible association with Dnd1. Subsequently, we subjected whole-cell extracts to immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-HA antibodies, extracted RNA, and performed RPAs to detect the interacting RNAs. This analysis revealed clear binding of Dnd1 to endogenous p27 and cyclophilin mRNAs but not to hTR, a nontranslated-RNA coding for human telomerase RNA (Figure 2C) (Kedde et al., 2006). The interaction of Dnd1 with p27 and cyclophilin required its intact RNA-binding capacity, as no apparent interaction was observed with the Dnd1Y104C mutant. Furthermore, no specific association was detected with miR-221, even when it was cotransfected with Dnd1. Immunoblot analysis with HA antibody confirmed the expression and equal immunoprecipitation of Dnd1 and PAK4 (Figure 2D). Altogether, these results demonstrate that Dnd1 binds mRNAs but not miRNAs to block miRNA activity.
793 Dnd1 Alleviates miR-430 Repression of Nanos1 and TDRD7 in Primordial Germ Cells of Zebrafish
794 We next examined the function of Dnd1 in zebrafish to question whether the relief of mRNA-mediated repression described above is part of the in vivo function of Dnd1 in the context of a developing organism. Whereas Dnd1 has been shown to be essential for germline development in zebrafish and mouse, the actual molecular mechanisms by which it exerts its function are unknown (Weidinger et al., 2003 and Youngren et al., 2005). We followed the expression changes of three germline specific genes: nanos1, TDRD7, and Vasa. The specific expression of nanos1 and TDRD7 in the PGCs is considered to be the result of miR-430-dependent inhibition in somatic cells, while Vasa regulation is miR-430 independent (Mishima et al., 2006). Indeed, mutating the single miR-430 site in the 3′UTR of either nanos1 or TDRD7 results in ubiquitous expression. However, while PGCs allow nanos1 and TDRD7 expression, they also express miR-430, suggesting that miR-430-induced repression of these genes is suppressed in PGCs (Mishima et al., 2006).
795 To study Dnd1 function, we knocked down the translation of the gene in zebrafish embryos using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides. RNA was extracted from these embryos, and the endogenous levels of the germline-specific genes (nanos1, TDRD7, and Vasa) were compared to Odc1, a ubiquitously expressed gene. In line with our hypothesis, the inhibition of endogenous Dnd1 caused a marked reduction in endogenous nanos1 and TDRD7 mRNA levels, but not Vasa (Figures 3A and S2A). Then, we cloned the 3′UTRs of nanos1, TDRD7, and control Vasa downstream of fluorescence marker genes, to determine whether the Dnd1 effect is mediated through their 3′UTR. Similar to the endogenous expression pattern, the injection of RNA, encoding a fluorescent marker gene fused to the 3′UTR of nanos1, TDRD7, or Vasa, into zebrafish embryos leads to preferential fluorescence in PGCs ( Koprunner et al. [2001] and data not shown). Upon Dnd1 knockdown, quantitative pixel-intensity analysis shows a clear and significant reduction in red fluorescent signal (DsRed-nos1 3′UTR or DsRed-TDRD7 3′UTR), but not green (coinjected GFP-vasa 3′UTR) in PGCs ( Figures 3B and S2B), indicating that Dnd1 affects gene expression through the 3′UTR of nanos1 and TDRD7. Next, we examined whether the reduction in nanos1 and TDRD7 following loss of Dnd1 depends on the ability of miR-430 to interact with these genes. Both nanos1 and TDRD7 harbor one miR430-targeting site ( Figures 3C and S2C). We therefore compared the expression of marker genes fused to a wild-type or a mutated miR-430-targeting site in nos1 3′UTR and TDRD7 3′UTR. Quantitative pixel-intensity analysis showed that the reduction in fluorescence resulting from knocking down Dnd1 function was effectively suppressed by mutating the miR-430-targeting site ( Figures 3C and S2C). Altogether, our data suggest that Dnd1 functions to relieve miR-430-mediated nanos1 and TDRD7 inhibition in zebrafish PGCs.

803 U-Rich Regions Mediate Dnd1 Binding and Function
804 Dnd1 contains two single-strand RNA recognition motifs, spanning approximately residues 60–131 and 140–213. Our data suggest that these domains bind mRNAs at specific sites. A BLASTP search of the Dnd1 sequence against the database of known structures (the PDB) revealed several significant homologs (E values of 10−5 and 10−3) and allowed straightforward homology-based modeling using the SWISS-MODEL server (Schwede et al., 2003). Superimposing the two homology-modeled domains in the structure of the similar Drosophila sex-lethal protein bound to uridine-rich single-stranded RNA indicated clearly that Dnd1 has all the hallmarks necessary to bind U-rich single-stranded RNA ( Handa et al., 1999). We therefore reasoned that Dnd1 might also bind U-rich regions (URRs). Interestingly, two URRs are found in between the two miR-221-binding sites in p27 3′UTR ( Figure 4A, marked purple). To test whether the region in between the two miRNA sites is sufficient to confer Dnd1 activity, we cloned it into a luciferase reporter vector (p27 3′UTR(196–300)). Figure 4B shows that this minimal region is sufficient to allow full repression by miR-221 and derepression by Dnd1. To more specifically address the role of the URRs, we generated two mutants: mutant 1, in which the two URRs were replaced by non-URRs, and mutant 2, where adjacent sequences were similarly mutated as control. Importantly, mutating the URRs, but not the adjacent sites, conferred resistance to the Dnd1 effect ( Figure 4C). No significant change in the repression activity of miR-221 was noted in mutant 2 (data not shown), indicating that these mutations did not affect miR-221-mediated repression of the p27 3′UTR. To further investigate the role of each URR, three more mutants were produced where either URR 1 or 2 were mutated ( Figure 4A). Both mutants supported full Dnd1 activity ( Figures 4C and 4D), suggesting that Dnd1 requires at least one URR adjacent to the miR-221 sites to function.

Beads were incubated with the RNA for 45 min at 6°C, washed, and subjected to RPA using probes to detect luciferase and cyclophilin mRNAs, and the noncoding human telomerase RNA (hTR).
811 Figure options
812 Next, we examined whether the URRs serve as docking sites for Dnd1. We immunoprecipitated (IP) HA-tagged Dnd1, Dnd1(Y104C), or control proteins from HEK293 cells and incubated them with RNA purified from MCF-7 cells expressing control vector, wild-type, or mutant 1 luciferase-p27 3′UTR(196–300). As detected by RPA on the bound material, a clear and significant enrichment of luciferase-p27 3′UTR(196–300) was observed when wild-type Dnd1-HA was used for the pull down assay (Figure 4E). In contrast, no significant pull down of luciferase was observed when the URRs of luciferase-p27 3′UTR were mutated (mutant 1) or with Dnd1(Y104C). The specificity of the binding as well as the equal efficiency of pull-down was demonstrated by absence of binding between Dnd1 and endogenous hTR, while equal precipitation of endogenous cyclophilin was seen in all extracts (Figure 4E). Although we cannot rule out that mutations in URRs have effects on the binding of other RBPs, our results suggest that Dnd1 binds URRs and thereby mediates suppression of miRNAs.
813 To test the in vivo relevance of URRs to Dnd1 function, we mutated URRs found within the zebrafish nos1 and TDRD7 3′UTRs and tested the effect of these mutations on gene expression. Figure 5A shows that mutating one URR (mut3, downstream of miR-430 site) of nos1 3′UTR reduced its expression. Similar results were obtained with TDRD7 3′UTR ( Figure S2D). To test whether the effect of URR mutation was dependent on miRNA function, we introduced the mutation of the URR in the background of the miR-430 target-site mutant. Figure 5B shows that mut3 did not reduce gene expression when miR-430 target site was mutated, suggesting that also in this case Dnd1 effect is miRNA dependent.

820 Mechanism of Dnd1 Function
821 Our results point to a model by which Dnd1 positively regulates gene expression by prohibiting miRNA-mediated gene suppression. To test this model we examined the direct interaction of miR-221 with its target p27 in human HEK293 cells, in the presence or absence of human Dnd1. We designed a synthetic RNA duplex mimicking miR-221 where the sense oligo was tagged with a 3′-biotin group for efficient pull-down using streptavidin beads. As control, we used a seed mutated, biotin-tagged, miR-221 duplex. The activity of these tagged molecules toward p27 3′UTR was verified in a luciferase assay (Figure S3) and Dnd1 toward p27 in western blot (Figure 6A, left). As HEK293T cells express miR-221, exogenous introduction of miR-221 results in only a slight effect on p27 expression, while introduction of human Dnd1 raises p27 levels (see also Figure 1C). Subsequently, we examined whole-cell extracts and pull-downs from the same cell populations using RPA and detected a specific association between wild-type miR-221 and endogenous p27 mRNA (Figure 6A, middle and right panels). No specific interaction was observed with hTR, our negative control. Most intriguingly, introduction of human Dnd1 completely abolished the interaction of miR-221 with p27 mRNA, indicating that Dnd1 inhibits miR-221 accessibility. Collectively, our results indicate that Dnd1 counteracts miRNA function by binding URRs in 3′UTRs of mRNAs and reducing their affinity to miRNAs (Figure 6B). However, we cannot exclude at this point that additional functions, such as counteracting RISC activity or subcellular sequestration, may contribute to Dnd1 activity.

Pull-down and whole-cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblot and RPA. Note, because HEK293T cells endogenously express miR-221, only a moderate reduction in p27 level was observed upon introduction of miR-221 oligos, while Dnd1 expression induced p27 expression. The results are represented as means and SD from three independent experiments.

828 Discussion
829 In this study we provide evidence that primordial germ cells possess factors such as Dnd1 that protect the expression of several genes from repression by miRNAs, as exemplified by miR-430. The expression of at least some miR-430 RNA targets, such as nanos1 and TDRD7, is allowed in primordial germ cells in the presence of miR-430. Similarly, the expression of LATS2, a target gene for the miR-372-family, is dependent on the expression of Dnd1 in Tera1, a human cell line derived from a germ-cell tumor that contains high levels of the miR-372 family. Our findings provide an explanation for this phenomenon. We suggest that Dnd1 suppresses miR-430 and miR-372-family function toward several of its mRNA targets by binding to URRs that are located within these mRNAs. Our results pinpoint the mechanism by which Dnd1 exerts its function. Binding of Dnd1 to mRNAs prohibits miRNA interaction.
830 Dnd1 in Germ-Cell Development
831 Both in zebrafish and in mouse, Dnd1 is essential for germ-cell survival, whereas in the 129-mouse background it induces testicular germ-cell tumors (TGCTs) arising from the few germ cells that develop in the absence of Dnd1 (Weidinger et al., 2003 and Youngren et al., 2005). These tumors resemble human testicular germ-cell tumors, which are the most common cancers affecting young men (Oosterhuis and Looijenga, 2005 and Youngren et al., 2005). It remains to be established which mutation(s) from the 129 strain synergize with the Dnd1 mutation to cause the development of TGCTs. However, recently three protein-coding genes, from which two are RBPs and one miRNA, were identified to be candidate disease genes from the 129 strain (Zhu et al., 2007). Additionally, a recent finding in C. elegans showed that disruption of the germ plasm by loss of two genes involved in RNA biology in these animals can also lead to the development of similar tumors ( Ciosk et al., 2006). Our results demonstrate that loss of Dnd1 enhances miRNA repression of some genes that are essential for primordial germ-cell development ( Koprunner et al., 2001) (among them nanos1 and TDRD7) and predict that this mechanism can be responsible for defects in germ-cell survival or for tumor formation. Whether protection of mRNAs from miRNAs is the only function of Dnd1 in germ cells remains to be investigated. Nevertheless, our results show that counteracting or balancing miRNA function is important during development, at least to maintain viable and functional germ lines in zebrafish and mouse.
832 Dnd1 and Other RBPs
833 Recent publications have implicated mechanisms that counteract the activity of miRNAs on specific mRNAs (Ashraf et al., 2006, Bhattacharyya et al., 2006 and Schratt et al., 2006). Together with these studies, our data unveil a dynamic regulation of miRNA suppression on the 3′UTRs of target mRNAs. The most relevant work showed that HuR (ELAV1), an AU-rich element (ARE) binding protein, relieves CAT-1 mRNA from miR-122-mediated repression, a process that involves binding of HuR to the 3′UTR of CAT-1 mRNA (Bhattacharyya et al., 2006). The mechanism of HuR action is yet unknown. Here, we identified Dnd1, another RBP, whose activity is comparable to HuR. However, our results highlight several differences between Dnd1 and HuR. While Dnd1 depends on URRs to relieve the miRNA repression, HuR depends on AU-rich elements. Second, Dnd1 seems to have a broad effect, as we have strong evidence showing that the repression of p27 by miR-221, LATS2 by miR-372, connexin-43 by miR-1 and -206 (Anderson et al., 2006), and Nanos and TDRD7 by miR-430 in zebrafish PGCs, are all being antagonized by Dnd1; for now HuR seems to have a more restricted function, suppressing CAT-1 expression. Last, the expression of HuR is induced following stress in liver cells, whereas Dnd1 expression is restricted to primordial germ cells and certain neuronal tissues (Youngren et al., 2005). By binding to mRNA, Dnd1 prevents miRNA-mediated repression. Whether this is a general mechanism applicable to HuR, or other RBPs, remains to be seen.
834 Counteracting miRNAs and siRNAs
835 Our work shows that Dnd1 activity can counteract gene silencing induced by miRNAs but not by siRNA-mediated RNA interference (RNAi). When one miR-221-targeting site in p27 3′UTR was converted to a full miR-221 complementary sequence (Figure 2B) as well as when a fully complementary shRNA was used to target the 3′UTR of LATS2 (Figure S4), Dnd1 function was lost. Since Dnd1 associates with mRNA and not with miRNAs, we can envision two possibilities that could provide an explanation. (1) Dnd1 binding could change the RNA structure to be unfavorable for miRNA binding by, for example, enforcing a secondary structure that hides the sequence required for miRNA-seed recognition. As siRNAs do not entirely depend on seed sequences and their association with mRNAs is tighter, their binding to 3′UTRs could therefore be less affected. (2) Dnd1 could localize mRNAs to locations in the cell that are not accessible to miRNA-mediated silencing but still mRNA degradation by an RNAi-mediated mechanism is possible.
836 3′UTRs as Binding Platforms for Regulating miRNAs and RBPs
837 Our results strongly suggest that the 3′UTRs of at least some mRNAs are binding platforms for both miRNAs that repress translation and RBPs that regulate this repression. In particular, RBPs can restore gene expression in the presence of inhibitory miRNAs. This mode of regulation has several consequences. First, as it affects protein synthesis and mRNA stability rather than controlling the expression of miRNAs in the cells, it is potentially a very rapid mechanism. Second, relief of repression can be exerted simultaneously on only a subset of the miRNA-targeted mRNAs, thereby giving modularity to miRNA function. Third, it adds robustness to expression patterns as different RBPs can in principle relieve the repression of different sets of mRNAs, even if these are regulated by the same miRNA. Fourth, this mechanism allows differential gene regulation in different tissues while keeping the expression of both miRNAs and mRNAs constant in the cell. One implication of this mode of regulation is that the presence of a miRNA and its target in the same tissue does not necessarily result in repression, therefore allowing coexpression of both miRNA and target mRNA. However, how broad Dnd1 function is: how many mRNAs and how many miRNAs are affected by Dnd1 remains to be elucidated. Our results indicate that several mRNAs and miRNAs are potentially regulated by Dnd1. Genome-wide proteome and RNome analysis comparing normal cells to cells lacking Dnd1 may address these issues in the future.
838 Experimental Procedures
839 Constructs and Antibodies
840 miR-Vec constructs were described before (Voorhoeve et al., 2006), and Dnd1 open-reading frames were cloned as described (Weidinger et al., 2003) into a pCS2-based CMV expression vector to contain a double carboxy-terminal HA tag. Dnd1 homologs ACF (IOH52413.1), HNRPR (IRALp962F134.1), LOC-166863 (IRAKp961H0534.1), and SYNCRIP (IRATp970H1055D) were similarly cloned into this vector (sequences obtained from RZPD Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung GmbH; Berlin, Germany). The PAK4-HA expression vector was described (Wells et al., 2002). The 3′UTRs of p27 and connexin-43 were PCR amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into pGL3 (Promega) downstream of the luciferase gene; constructs bearing the LATS2 3′UTR were described (Voorhoeve et al., 2006). The mutations in pGL3-p27mut-3′UTR were cloned by PCR to contain the following sequences from the original 3′UTR from nt 183–282: GCCTCTAAAAGCGTTGGGGATCCCATTATGCAATTAGGTTTTTCCTTATTTGCTTCATTGTACTACCTGTGTATATAGTTTTTACCTTTTGGATCCCAC.

Constructs for RPA detection of hTR and cyclophilin were described ( Kedde et al., 2006), antisense probes for detection of p27 (nt 340–577) and firefly luciferase (nucleotides 0–156) were generated by PCR, a T7 promoter sequence was included for labeling. shRNA for pasha was described before ( Gregory et al., 2004); the shDnd1 sequence is GCAGCGACTTCGCCAGCAG—this was cloned in pSUPER. All constructs were sequence verified.
841 Antibodies used were CDK4 (C-22), HA Y-11 (sc805), Cdc6 180.2 (sc9964) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Tubulin (YL1/2 ECACC), and rabbit GFP.
842 Cell Culture, Transfections, and Dual Luciferase-Activity Analysis
843 MCF7 and HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM and Tera1 in McCoy's 5A supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in 5% CO2 at 37°C. For protein-expression analysis and immunoprecipitation HEK293 cells were transiently transfected using calcium-phosphate precipitation.
844 MCF7- and Tera1 cells were transfected using PEI (Polysciences, Inc.) or Fugene (Roche), respectively, for luciferase analysis with 10 ng of reporter, 5 ng of renilla control plasmid, and 250 ng of either miR-Vec or miR-Vec control, and 250 ng of either miR-Vec control or expression plasmid for Dnd1 or homologs. Dual luciferase-activity assays were performed 48 hr after transfection according to the manufacturer's directions (Promega). The results are represented as means and standard deviation (SD) from three independent experiments.
845 Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting, miRNA Pull-Down, and RNase Protection Assays
846 Dnd1 was IPed from extracts of transfected HEK293 cells using GammaBind G Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Extracts were made and beads were washed with lysis buffer (125 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 0,1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Tween-20, 10 mM MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture [Roche Applied Science]). Interaction studies were performed with total RNA from transfected MCF7 cells extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and split over IP samples in 50 μl lysis buffer suplemented with RNase-OUT (Invitrogen). Reactions were carried out for 45 min in an orbital shaker placed at 6°C; thereafter, beads were washed and RNA was extracted to be subjected to RPA.
847 For western blot analysis, extracts were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Milipore). Western blots were developed with Supersignal (Pierce) or ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to film (Kodak). Cellular fractionation was performed on MCF7 cells with NE-PER kits from Pierce, according to manufacturer's instructions.
848 Pull-downs with miRNAs were performed with miRNA oligos where the sense strand contains a biotin group at its 3′ end (Dharmacon) in the mutant miRNA the seed (AGC UAC AUU) was mutated to AGG AUC CUU. Cells were transfected with FuGENE (Roche) (150 nM miRNA and 10 μg of control or Dnd1 vector) and after 48 hr lysed in 20 mM Tris with pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.05% NP40, 60U RNaseOUT/ml (invitrogen), 1 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors (Roche). miRNAs were pulled down with streptavidin sepharose beads (GE healthcare) preblocked with yeast tRNA (Invitrogen) and RNase free BSA, (Ambion), and washed four times with lysis buffer. RNA was extracted and subjected to RPA.
849 RPAs for Luciferase, p27, cyclophilin, and hTR were performed using the HybSpeed RPA and MAXIscript kits from Ambion as described (Kedde et al., 2006). For miR-221 we used mirVana kits (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the primer GCAACAGCTACATTGTCTGCTGGGTTTCAGGCTcctgtctc. We used 2 μg of total RNA (∼2% of input) and half of IP samples per reaction.
850 Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis
851 RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA (from 3 μg RNA) was synthesized with superscript III and primed with oligo-dT according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitogen). Primers for zebrafish qPCR were nanos1 For/Rev: AGACTGAGGCCGTGTACACCTCTCACTACT / GAGCAGTAGTTCTTGTCCACCATCG, ODC For/Rev: ACACTATGACGGCTTGCACCG / CCCACTGACTGCACGATCTGG, vasa1 For/Rev: CCTGCTGCCTATCCTACAGC / CAGGTCCCGTATGCAAACTT, TDRD7 For/Rev: TCTACCCAGCGGAAGCTTTA / CTGGTGTCCCACTGGTCTTT. Primers for human Dnd1 were For/Rev: CTCCACAGGCACCCTGAATG / GGTGCCATAGGTCCCTGTCC; other primers were as described (Voorhoeve et al., 2006). Analyses were carried out using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and Chromo 4 system (BioRad Laboratories).
852 Zebrafish Strain and Fish Maintenance
853 Zebrafish (Danio rerio) of the AB genetic background were maintained, raised, and staged as previously described ( Kimmel et al., 1995 and Westerfield, 1995).
854 Morpholino Knockdown of Dnd1
855 The dead end morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (dnd MO, 5′-GCTGGGCATCCATGTCTCCGACCAT-3′) and the standard control MO were obtained from Genetools, Philomath, OR. Six hundred picograms were injected into one-cell stage embryos to efficiently knock down Dnd1 function (Weidinger et al., 2003).
856 RNA Expression Constructs
857 Capped sense RNA was synthesized using the mMessageMachine kit (Ambion) and microinjected into one-cell stage embryos. The following constructs were used: pSP64T-mgfp-vasa-3′UTR (GFP-3′vasa in Figure 3A) ( Wolke et al., 2002), pSP64T-mgfp-nos1-3′UTR ( Koprunner et al., 2001), pSP64T-vasa-dsRedEx-nos1-3′UTR (Ds-Red-3′nos1 in Figure 3B), pSP64T-dsRedEx-nos1-3′UTR, T3-venus-nos1-3′UTR (3′nos1wt in Figures 3C and 5). To obtain a mutation in the miR-430-binding site pSP64T-ecfp-nos1-3′UTR was amplified using primers (GTCTTTTTGTGTGTGTGTAT and CAAAATCAAACAGTGAACGC) resulting in pSP64T-ecfp-nos1-3′UTRmut1 (3′nos1mut1 in Figure 3C). To obtain a mutation in the putative Dnd interacting sequence 1 pSP64T-mgfp-nos1-3′UTR was amplified using primers (CAGCACTTTTTGTGTGTGTGTATA and GCTCAAACAGTGAACGCACACAT) resulting in pSP64T-mgfp-nos1-3′UTRmut2 (3′nos1mut2 in Figure 5). To obtain a mutation in the putative Dnd-interacting sequence 2 pSP64T-mgfp-nos1-3′UTR was amplified using primers (CAGTGTGCACTGGTGTTGTGTT and GCTAAAACACAGCAAACACACACA) resulting in pSP64T-mgfp-nos1-3′UTRmut3 (3′nos1mut3 in Figure 5). To obtain a double mutation in both putative Dnd-interacting sequences pSP64T-mgfp-nos1-3′UTRmut2 was amplified using primers (CAGTGTGCACTGGTGTTGTGTT and GCTAAAACACAGCAAACACACACA) resulting in pSP64T-mgfp-nos1-3′UTRmut2+3 (3′nos1mut2+3 in Figure 5). To obtain a double mutation in the putative Dnd-interacting sequence 2 and in the miR-430-binding site, pSP64T-mgfp-nos1-3′UTRmut1 was amplified using primers (CAGTGTGCACTGGTGTTGTGTT and GCTAAAACACAGCAAACACACACA) resulting in pSP64T-mgfp-nos1-3′UTRmut1+3 (3′nos1mut1+3 in Figure 5). To obtain a triple mutation in both putative Dnd-interacting sequences and in the miR-430-binding site, pSP64T-mgfp-nos1-3′UTRmut2+3 was amplified using primers (GTCTTTTTGTGTGTGTGTAT and ACCTGGCTCAAACAGTGAACGC) resulting in pSP64T-mgfp-nos1-3′UTRmut1+2+3 (3′nos1mut1+2+3 in Figure 5). To obtain pSP64T-dsRedEx-TDRD7-3′UTR (3′TDRD7 in Figures S2B and S2C), pSP64T-mgfp-TDRD7-3′UTR (3′TDRD7wt in Figure S2D) and pSP6T-eyfp-TDRD7-3′UTR the 3′UTR of TDRD7 (EF643554) was amplified using primers (AAACTCGAGTACTCTCAGAACTGCACTTTC and AAATCTAGATAATACAACAAAACCTGAACACC) and cloned into corresponding vectors. To obtain a mutation in the miR-430- binding site pSP64T-mgfp-TDRD7-3′UTR was amplified with primer (TCTTTGGTTTGTTTTGCTGTGTTT/CCAAAATCAAAAAGTACAAACAATG) and subloned into an ecfp-containing vector resulting in pSP64T-ecfp-TDRD7-3′UTRmut1 (3′TDRD7mut1 in Figure S2). To obtain a mutation in the putative Dnd-interacting sequence 2 pSP64T-mgfp-TDRD7-3′UTR was amplified using primers (CAGCACTTTGGTTTGTTTGCT and GCTCAAAAAGTACAAACAATGC) resulting in pSP64T-mgfp-TDRD7-3′UTRmut2 (3′TDRD7mut1 in Figure S2).
858 Fluorescence Microscopy and Imaging of Live Cells
859 Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope controlled by the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). Average pixel intensity in germ cells was measured and subtracted from the background signal using the ImageJ software. Error bars represent the SEM. The p values were calculated using t test.

1087 Abstract
1088 Background
1089 Autophagy is a vesicular trafficking process responsible for the degradation of long-lived, misfolded or abnormal proteins, as well as damaged or surplus organelles. Abnormalities of the autophagic activity may result in the accumulation of protein aggregates, organelle dysfunction, and autophagy disorders were associated with various diseases. Hence, mechanisms of autophagy regulation are under exploration.
1090 Methods
1091 Over-expression of hsa-miR-376a1 (shortly MIR376A) was performed to evaluate its effects on autophagy. Autophagy-related targets of the miRNA were predicted using Microcosm Targets and MIRanda bioinformatics tools and experimentally validated. Endogenous miRNA was blocked using antagomirs and the effects on target expression and autophagy were analyzed. Luciferase tests were performed to confirm that 3′ UTR sequences in target genes were functional. Differential expression of MIR376A and the related MIR376B was compared using TaqMan quantitative PCR.
1092 Results
1093 Here, we demonstrated that, a microRNA (miRNA) from the DLK1/GTL2 gene cluster, MIR376A, played an important role in autophagy regulation. We showed that, amino acid and serum starvation-induced autophagy was blocked by MIR376A overexpression in MCF-7 and Huh7 cells. MIR376A shared the same seed sequence and had overlapping targets with MIR376B, and similarly blocked the expression of key autophagy proteins ATG4C and BECN1 (Beclin 1). Indeed, 3′ UTR sequences in the mRNA of these autophagy proteins were responsive to MIR376A in luciferase assays. Antagomir tests showed that, endogenous MIR376A was participating to the control of ATG4C and BECN1 transcript and protein levels. Moreover, blockage of endogenous MIR376A accelerated starvation-induced autophagic activity. Interestingly, MIR376A and MIR376B levels were increased with different kinetics in response to starvation stress and tissue-specific level differences were also observed, pointing out to an overlapping but miRNA-specific biological role.
1094 Conclusions
1095 Our findings underline the importance of miRNAs encoded by the DLK1/GTL2 gene cluster in stress-response control mechanisms, and introduce MIR376A as a new regulator of autophagy.

1097 Introduction
1098 Two major degradation pathways, namely macroautophagy (autophagy herein) and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, are operational in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Functional at a basal level for long-lived protein degradation and organelle turnover under normal conditions, autophagy is rapidly upregulated in response to both extracellular (e.g. nutrient starvation, hypoxia) and intracellular (e.g. accumulation of unfolded proteins, damaged organelles, pathogens) stress factors.[1] Concerted action of several protein complexes formed by at least 32 different autophagy (ATG) proteins result in the formation of double- or multi-membrane vesicles called autophagic vesicles or autophagosomes.[2] These vesicles enwrap cargo molecules and carry them to lysosomes for degradation, resulting in the recycling of their constituents for reuse by the cell.[3], [4]
1099 Protein complexes playing a role in autophagosome formation are numerous. A key event is the accumulation of a modified lipid molecule, phosphoinositol 3-phosphate on the ER and mitochondrial membranes, marking the autophagic vesicle nucleation centers.[2] A phosphoinositol 3-kinase, VPS34, is responsible for the conversion of membrane associated inositol lipids into phosphoinositol 3-phosphate (PI3-P). BECN1 was discovered as a master regulator of the VPS34 activity and autophagosome formation.[2] Autophagic vesicle membrane elongation, growth and closure occur through the action of two ubiqituination-like protein conjugation systems.[5] The first system is rather regulatory, resulting in the covalent conjugation of a ubiquitin-like protein ATG12 to ATG5, and in the eventual formation of a larger complex including the ATG16 protein. The ATG12-5-16 complex serves as a E3 ubiquitin ligase-like enzyme for the second reaction involving covalent attachment of a lipid, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), to a carboxy-terminal (C-ter) glycine residue of the autophagy-related MAP1LC3 (or simply LC3) protein.[6] To expose the key glycine residue for conjugation, prior C-ter cleavage of pro-LC3 by ATG4 proteins is required. Lipid conjugated LC3 is necessary for the elongation of autophagic membranes and completion of the vesicles.[7] Indeed, cells lacking one of the conjugation reaction components were shown to harbor autophagy defects.[8]
1100 Recent studies introduced microRNAs (miRNAs) as novel regulators of autophagy.[9], [10], [11] miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs serving as negative regulators of gene expression.[12] By base pairing with sequences found mainly in the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of specific mRNAs, miRNAs lead to mRNA instability and/or translation inhibition resulting in a decrease in target gene expression.[13] A single miRNA may target tens to hundreds of mRNAs, hence may co-regulate and coordinate a number of cellular proteins and pathways at once.[14] So far, only a handful of miRNAs were shown to directly affect the autophagic activity. Among them, MIR376B was introduced as a new regulator of starvation and mTOR-inhibition-related autophagy.[10] MIR376B blocked autophagy by affecting the expression of two key autophagy proteins, namely ATG4C and BECN1. MIR376B belongs to a miRNA gene family encoded from a gene cluster region in the human chromosome 14q32, called the DLK1/GTL2 region.[15], [16], [17] Therefore, we wondered whether other miRNAs from the same region could play a role in autophagy regulation.
1101 Here, we report that another miRNA from the DLK1/GTL2 region, namely hsa-miR-376a1 (hereafter MIR376A) containing a seed sequence similar to that of MIR376B, is a novel regulator of autophagy. Overexpression of MIR376A attenuated starvation-induced autophagic activity and did so by modulating cellular ATG4C and BECN1 mRNA and protein levels. We showed that, miRNA response elements (MRE) in the 3′UTR region of these genes were direct targets of MIR376A. Importantly, antagomir-mediated suppression of endogenous MIR376A levels led to an increase in ATG4C and BECN1 expression and resulted in autophagy stimulation. Our findings underline the importance of miRNAs coded by the DLK1/GTL2 genomic region in physiological regulation and control of the autophagic activity.

1103 Results
1104 MIR376A overexpression blocked autophagy
1105 In an unbiased screen, we discovered several miRNAs, including MIR376B and MIR181A as inhibitors of starvation-induced autophagy [10], [11] MIR376B is encoded from a gene region called, DLK1/GTL2 containing several miRNA genes (Figure 1A). Although the nucleotide sequences of at least seven miRNA genes found in this region differed considerably, the seed sequences (around 8 nucleotide long miRNA core sequences responsible for target mRNA recognition) of MIR376A1, MIR376A2 and MIRB2 were identical to that of the MIR376B (Figure 1B and C). Since in our screen, MIR376A1 was also a hit, we wondered whether this miRNA would regulate autophagy.

1107 Figure 1
1108 MIR376 family miRNAs in the DLKI/GTL2 gene cluster.
1109 Firstly, we transiently overexpressed MIR376A1 (MIR376A herein) together with the autophagy marker GFP-LC3 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Detection of cytoplasmic puncta formation by otherwise soluble GFP-fused MAP1LC3 (shortly LC3) protein is a commonly used method to follow autophagy activation using microscopy. As shown in Figure 2A and B, overexpressed MIR376A could repress starvation-induced GFP-LC3 puncta formation. To confirm these results with a complementary technique, we analyzed the effect of MIR376A overexpression on the conversion of endogenous free LC3 protein (LC3-I) to its lipidated and autophagic vesicle-associated form (LC3-II). As seen in Figure 2C, LC3-I conversion to LC3-II was decreased in miRNA transfected MCF-7 cells compared to controls.

1111 Figure 2
1112 Effect of MIR376A overexpression on autophagy.
1113 Autophagic cargo receptor protein p62/SQSTM1 is also carried by autophagosomes to lysosomes and degraded there during the process.[18] Indeed, starvation resulted in SQSTM1 degradation in cells transfected with the control miRNAs, and inhibition of the lysosomal enzymes blocked its degradation (Figure 2D). Yet, in starved cells overexpressing MIR376A, SQSTM1 was neither degraded following starvation, nor accumulated after lysosomal inhibition, confirming autophagy blocking activity of the miRNA.
1114 We also performed tests in Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Similar to the results obtained in MCF-7 cells, MIR376A overexpression could block starvation-induced GFP-LC3 dot formation (Figure 3A and B) and LC3 lipidation (Figure 3C) in Huh7 cells as well.
1115 Figure 3
1116 Figure 3
1117 MIR376A overexpression blocked autophagy in Huh-7 cells.
1118 All these results showed that, MIR376A, another gene encoded by the miRNA gene cluster in the DLK1/GTL2 genomic region, was a new miRNA regulator of starvation-activated autophagy.
1119 Autophagy-related targets of MIR376A
1120 We have previously described ATG4C and BECN1 as autophagy-related targets of MIR376B. Since MIR376A seed sequence was identical to that of MIR376B, it could potentially target the MRE sequences found in the 3′ UTR regions of these autophagy genes (Figure 4A and B). Indeed, mRNA levels of both genes were decreased upon MIR376A overexpression (Figure 4C and D). Additionally, MIR376A overexpression led to a decrease in the levels of both ATG4C (Figure 4E) and BECN1 (Figure 4F) proteins. Therefore, similar to MIR376B, MIR376A could also regulate expression levels of two key proteins in the autophagy pathway.
1121 Figure 4
1122 Figure 4
1123 ATG4C and BECN1 were targets of MIR376A.
1124 Effect of MIR376A antagomirs on ATG4C and BECN1 levels
1125 To check whether blockage of the endogenous miRNA would affect ATG4C and BECN1 expression levels, we used antagomirs (chemically engineered oligonucleotide anti-miRNAs) specifically neutralizing MIR376A. While control antagomirs (CNT-Ant) showed no significant effect, introduction of MIR376A-specific antagomirs (Ant-376A) into cells led to a significant increase in ATG4C mRNA (Figure 5A) and protein levels (Figure 5C). Similar antagomir-related changes were observed in BECN1 mRNA (Figure 5B) and protein (Figure 5D) levels. Therefore, endogenously expressed cellular MIR376A also played a role in the suppression of autophagy-related gene expression.

1127 Figure 5
1128 Effect of antagomirs on MIR376A target expression.
1129 MIR376A directly targeted ATG4C and BECN1 3′ UTR sequences
1130 To prove that negative regulation of the autophagy proteins by MIR376A was a result of a direct effect of the miRNA, reporter luciferase vectors containing predicted 3′ UTR MRE sequences in ATG4C and BECN1 mRNAs were prepared. Mutant versions of these vectors were constructed as well (Figure 6A and B). 293T cells were transfected with these constructs together with MIR-CNT or MIR376A, and luciferase activities were measured. Overexpression of MIR376A but not MIR-CNT resulted in a decrease in luciferase expression from vectors containing wild-type MRE sequences (Figure 6C and D, Wild-type). Mutation of the MREs in ATG4C or BECN1 sequences abolished the effect of the miRNA on luciferase expression (Figure 6C and D, Mutant). Therefore MIR376A controlled ATG4C and BECN1 levels by directly affecting specific MRE sequences in the 3′UTR regions of these autophagy genes.

1132 Figure 6
1133 MIR376A controlled miRNA-response elements (MREs) in ATG4C and BECN1 mRNA 3′ UTRs.
1134 Role of endogenous MIR376A in the control of starvation-induced autophagic activity
1135 To further reveal the role of endogenous MIR376A in autophagy regulation, we transfected cells with control or MIR376A antagomirs, and analyzed conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and SQSTM1 degradation as markers of the autophagic activity. Interestingly, we observed that blockage of endogenous MIR376A further increased LC3-II/I ratios (Figure 7A). Moreover, starvation-induced degradation of the autophagy receptor SQSTM1 was further increased in cells transfected with MIR376A antagomirs compared to controls (Figure 7B). These results underlined the importance of endogenous MIR376A activity in the control of the amplitude of starvation-induced autophagy responses of cells.

1137 Figure 7
1138 Endogenous MIR376A limits starvation-induced autophagy.
1139 Response of endogenous MIR376A and MIR376B levels to starvation
1140 We have previously reported that autophagy-related miRNAs accumulated following starvation or mTOR inhibition.[10], [11] To check whether endogenous MIR376A and MIR376B levels were similarly increased during starvation stress, we performed a kinetic analysis using TaqMan qPCR. Although cellular levels of MIR376A and MIR376B were increased in cells exposed to starvation stress, kinetics of the upregulation was different between individual miRNAs. In starved cells, while endogenous MIR376A reached peak levels following a 6 hours lag period (Figure 8A), endogenous MIR376B levels rapidly increased after 1 hr of stress, but the response was transient (Figure 8B). Therefore, the two miRNAs responded to autophagy-inducing starvation signals with different kinetics.

1145 Discussion
1146 In this study, we demonstrated that another miRNA encoded by the DLK1/GTL2 region and belonging to the MIR376 family, namely MIR376A was an autophagy regulatory miRNA. Inhibitory effect of MIR376A on autophagy was demonstrated using various autophagic tests including GFP-LC3 puncta analysis, LC3II/LC3I gel shift and p62/SQSTM1 degradation tests. The miRNA affected ATG4C and BECN1 protein levels as well as the mRNA levels. MIR376A directly and specifically affected the mRNAs of the autophagy genes, since MREs in the 3′ UTR of both ATG4C and BECN1 were responsive to the inhibitory effects of the miRNA in luciferase tests, and mutations in the relevant regions abolished the suppressive effects. Contribution of the endogenous MIR376A to the control of basal and stress-activated autophagy was documented as well. Specific antagomirs against the miRNA led to a clear increase in both ATG4C and BECN1 mRNA and protein levels, and stimulated autophagic activity in cells.
1147 Since ATG4C and BECN1 function at two different steps of autophagic vesicle formation, targeting of both of these key autophagy proteins at once by the MIR376 family of miRNAs allows a robust decrease in the autophagic activity. In fact, while BECN1 controls the production of PI3-P and regulates of autophagic vesicle nucleation sites, ATG4 is important for LC3 lipidation and in autophagic vesicle membrane elongation. In line with the importance of these proteins in autophagy control, both proteins were reported to be regulated by diverse signals and pathways. In fact, BECN1 was subject to regulation by transcriptional upregulation, protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation and ubiquitination.[19], [20], [21] ATG4 was also reported to be regulated in various ways including transcriptional upregulation and reactive oxygen species [22] Moreover, miRNAs other than MIR376 family were shown to target BECN1 or ATG4 as well. For example, miR-30a targeted BECN1 3′ UTR but at a different and unrelated MRE. Similarly, ATG4 was targeted by autophagy-related MIR101.[23]
1148 Although MIR376A and MIR376B genes are separated from each other by only hundreds of bases and their products are not identical but closely-related (Figure 1B and 1C). Hence, their cellular functions could be overlapping. Indeed, we have previously shown that MIR376B was also blocking starvation-induced autophagy through its effects on ATG4C and BECN1 levels. Yet, we observed in this study that kinetics of miRNA responses during starvation stress were divergent. While endogenous levels of MIR376A increased after 6 hours of starvation, MIR376B levels increased following a short starvation period, but declined rapidly. The observed difference in the response of MIR376A and MIR376B might be relevant to miRNA function during stress. Results presented here provide evidence that, the physiological function of these miRNAs is to control and limit the amplitude of autophagic activity which is strongly stimulated by starvation stress. A sequential accumulation of individual miRNAs might allow a sustained and a two-step control of the autophagic activity depending on the duration of stress. Since uncontrolled autophagic activity could be detrimental for cells, and under certain conditions lead to cell death [24] restriction of aberrant activation of autophagy by miRNAs under stressful conditions might prevent cellular demise and give cells a chance to recover a transient stress.
1149 Data presented here point out to the presence of distinct control mechanisms resulting in dissimilar MIR376A and MIR376B response kinetics. Transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms might be in the origin of these observations. According to Kawahara et.al (2007), miR-376 family members were transcribed as a long primary transcript.[17] Reports by Seitz et al. and Teferedegne et al. confirmed experimentally the presence of a common transcript including MIR376A and MIR376B.[16], [25] In line with these data, a recent study showed that the expression of MIR376A, MIR376B and MIR376C was regulated by a transcription factor called AIRE in a coordinated manner.[26] Although experimental confirmation is currently missing, our bioinformatics analyses revealed that predicted short promoter regions of these two miRNAs could be responsive to overlapping but different transcription factors, indicating that single miRNA transcripts could also co-exist (unpublished data by Ilknur Melis Durasi, Osman Ugur Sezerman and Devrim Gozuacik). If the dominant transcript is a long and polycistronic mRNA coding for both MIR376A and MIR376B, observed differences in the levels and stress-related kinetics of these miRNAs might be the result of posttranscriptional regulation. Indeed, posttranscriptional events were previously shown to affect stability and function of some miRNAs. For example, regulation by DICER was reported to affect the levels of let-7.[27] Moreover, complexes Ago proteins were shown to determine the stability of various miRNAs.[28] Further studies are required to reveal the nature and molecular details of posttranscriptional events that are responsible for the differential regulation of MIR376A and MIR376B levels under stress-inducing conditions.
1150 Differential editing of MIR376 family members was reported in a number of tissues.[17] For example, while +44 site in the seed sequence of MIR376A was not edited in the mouse cortex, in the same tissue MIR376B was highly edited (around 50–60%) at this position.[17] Since editing in the seed region was shown to change target specificity of miRNAs including MIR376A*[17], [29] in addition to relative ratios of MIR376A and MIR376B, ratios between edited versus non-edited versions of MIR376 family members might be important factors leading to changes in autophagy levels in different tissues and cells. Additionally, MIR376A might be compensating autophagy-related functions of MIR376B in tissues where the latter was predominantly edited and, vice versa. Overall, editing frequencies of MIR376 family members and their relative ratios might be critical factors determining the kinetics and the amplitude of autophagic responses in individual tissue and cell types. Further studies are required to analyze and integrate these observations to cellular and organismal autophagy responses.
1151 Tissue-specific expression differences were observed between MIR376A and MIR376B under physiological conditions. While MIR376B is highly expressed in the spleen and adrenal gland, MIR376A was reported to be abundant in the brain and uterus (Fig. S1).[30] A number of studies in the literature, showed the importance of MIR376A during development and differentiation-related events including erythroid differentiation [31], keratinocyte differentiation [32] and skeletal muscle development.[33] MIR376A was also shown to be upregulated during chemical and replicative senescence in human fibroblasts.[34]
1152 Additionally, changes in MIR376 levels were observed under pathological conditions. While MIR376A was downregulated in esophageal cancer [35] and melanomas [36] and upregulated in salivary gland adenomas,[37] and pancreatic carcinomas,[38], [39] MIR376B was differentially expressed in uterine leiomyomas [40] and renal cell carcinomas.[41] Moreover, changes in MIR376A levels could be used as a marker to distinguish acute myeloid leukemia subtypes, but MIR376B could serve as a breast cancer subtype marker.[42] Additionally, MIR376A and MIR376B were subjected to variable levels of editing in glioblastomas.[43]
1153 Autophagy serves as a cellular defense mechanism against various pathogens including viruses.[44], [45] Not surprisingly, as a countermeasure, viruses evolved ways of modulating autophagy during productive and latent stages of the viral infection.[46] miRNAs of both viral and cellular origins were shown to affect cellular responses to viruses such as apoptosis, therefore, it is possible that autophagy-regulating miRNAs play a role in the battle between viruses and the host. In line with a possible role of MIR376 family in virus-host interactions, a miRNA profiling revealed differential expression of MIR376A and MIR376B in control versus HIV-1 positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells.[47] In another study, an interesting interplay between viral miRNAs and MIR376A was reported.[48] MREs for MIR376A in the 3′ UTR of the MICB mRNA (a stress-induced ligand necessary for host cell recognition and destruction by natural killer cells) overlapped with the MRE of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) miRNA, miR-K12-7. The MIR376A MRE was also in the vicinity of that of miR-UL112 of human cytomegalo virus (HCMV). Surprisingly, when MIR376A was used in combination with KSHV or HCMV miRNA, no antagonism but an increase in target MICB downregulation was observed. In the light of our data, here contribution of MIR376A to viral infection might not be limited to the attenuation of immune responses through MICB downregulation, but it might also involve blockage of antiviral autophagic degradation, autophagy-related antigen presentation on MHC molecules and perhaps autophagic cell death. Indeed, KSHV was previously shown to downregulate autophagy, apoptosis and cell death using its viral FLIP and BCL-2 proteins that target autophagy-related proteins ATG3 and BECN1, respectively. [49], [50] MIR376A and possibly other autophagy-regulating miRNAs might be usurped by viruses to overcome the antiviral effects of autophagy.
1154 Altogether, our results underline the importance of MIR376A and MIR376B, and miRNAs in general, in the control of autophagic responses of cells and tissues. miRNA-mediated regulation provides a flexible and dynamic mechanism for the regulation of autophagy under various stress conditions, and adds another layer of regulation for critical cell death and survival decisions in health and disease.

1157 Plasmid constructs
1158 The pMSCV-blast-miR plasmids, containing either hsa-miR-376a1 human miRNA or control miRNA (hTR-human telomerase RNA), were constructed as described previously.[51] For luciferase tests, miRNA response elements (MRE) located in the 3′UTR of BECN1 or ATG4C genes (ATG4C Genbank accession number: AK027773, bases 2383-2403, and BECN1 Genbank accession number: NM_003766, bases 2030-2051), or their mutant versions were cloned into the 3′UTR region of the luciferase gene in the pGL3 vector (Promega, E1741) as previously described.[10] ATG4C plasmid was purchased from Origene (SC126496). BECN1 cDNA ORF was cloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression plasmid using RT-PCR.

1160 Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Sigma, D5671) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biochrom KG, S0115) and antibiotics (Penicillin/Streptomycin; Biological Industries, 03-031-1B) were used to culture MCF-7 human mammary carcinoma cells, Huh7 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and 293T human embryonic kidney cells in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator at 37°C. Cells were cultured in Earl’s balanced salt solution (EBSS; Biological Industries, BI02-010-1A) to activate starvation-induced autophagy. For autophagic flux analyses, cells were cultured in the absence or presence of lysosomal protease inhibitors E64d (10 μg/ml) (Santa Cruz, SC201280A) and pepstatin A (10 μg/ml) (Sigma, P5318).
1161 Polyethyleneimine (PEI; PolySciences Inc., 23966) transfection method was used to transiently transfect MCF-7 and Huh7 cells.[52] For transfection of 293T cells, calcium phosphate co-precipitation method was used according to standard protocols.
1162 Quantitative GFP-LC3 analyses
1163 48h post-transfection, GFP-LC3 dot positivity was quantified following 2 hours (MCF-7 cells) or 4 hours (Huh7 cells) starvation in the EBSS medium. 10 or 15 GFP-LC3 dots per cell were considered as a threshold for the basal autophagic activity in MCF-7 and Huh7 cells, respectively. Minimum 150 GFP positive cells were counted under each condition, and percentage of GFP-LC3 positivity was expressed as a percentage of GFP-LC3 dot positive cells within the total transfected cell population.

1165 Bioinformatics tools, Microcosm Targets (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/enright-srv/microcosm/cgi-bin/targets/v5/search.pl), and MiRanda (http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do) were utilized to determine miRNA potential target mRNAs.
1166 Immunoblotting and antibodies
1167 Protein extracts from cells were prepared and immunoblotted as previously described [53] using antibodies specific to BECN1 (Santa Cruz, sc-11427), LC3B (Novus, NB100-2331), ATG4C (Sigma-Aldrich, AB75056), SQSTM1 (Abnova, H00008878) and ACTB (Sigma-Aldrich, A5441). ImageJ software was used to quantify protein band intensities.[54]

1252 Abstract
1253 During development, tissue-specific transcription factors regulate both protein-coding and non-coding genes to control differentiation. Recent studies have established a dual role for the transcription factor Pax6 as both an activator and repressor of gene expression in the eye, central nervous system, and pancreas. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory activity of Pax6 is not fully understood. Here, we reveal that Trpm3 and the intronic microRNA gene miR-204 are co-regulated by Pax6 during eye development. miR-204 is probably the best known microRNA to function as a negative modulator of gene expression during eye development in vertebrates. Analysis of genes altered in mouse Pax6 mutants during lens development revealed significant over-representation of miR-204 targets among the genes up-regulated in the Pax6 mutant lens. A number of new targets of miR-204 were revealed, among them Sox11, a member of the SoxC family of pro-neuronal transcription factors, and an important regulator of eye development. Expression of Trpm/miR-204 and a few of its targets are also Pax6-dependent in medaka fish eyes. Collectively, this study identifies a novel evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which Pax6 controls the down-regulation of multiple genes through direct up-regulation of miR-204.

1255 Author Summary
1256 The transcription factor Pax6 is reiteratively employed in space and time for the establishment of progenitor pools and the differentiation of neuronal and non-neuronal lineages of the CNS, pancreas, and eye. Execution of these diverse developmental programs depends on simultaneous activation and repression of gene networks functioning downstream of Pax6. MicroRNAs function as inhibitors of gene expression. Many microRNA genes are transcribed through common promoters of host genes. In this study, using wide-scale analysis of changes in gene expression following Pax6 deletion in the lens, we discover that Pax6 regulates the gene Trpm3 and its hosted microRNA, miR-204. We then show that miR-204 suppresses several target genes in the lens, notably the neuronal gene Sox11. Lastly, by conducting parallel experiments in the medaka fish, we show that Pax6 control of miR-204 and its target genes is evolutionarily conserved between mammals and fish, stressing the biological importance of this pathway. Pax6 regulation of miR-204 explains part of the complex, divergent inhibitory activity of Pax6 in ocular progenitor cells, which is required to establish and maintain the identity and function of ocular tissues.

1258 Introduction
1259 Lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) such as Pax6 direct the development of multiple tissues through the regulation of gene networks that execute discrete developmental programs. Pax6 is essential for normal development of the central nervous system (CNS), pancreas, olfactory system and eye (reviewed in [1], [2]). Pax6 is considered a “master regulator” of eye development as it specifies the multiple cell lineages that comprise the eye in vertebrate and invertebrate species [3].
1260 During embryonic development, Pax6 protein is known to activate several target genes using two DNA-binding domains and a proline-serine-threonine transcription activating domain [4]–[6]. Pax6 may also enhance gene expression by recruiting chromatin-remodeling enzymes and alleviating heterochromatin repression [4], [7], [8]. In contrast, Pax6 has been found to function as a repressor of the lens crystallin genes Cryabb1 and Crygf, and of the photoreceptor TF Crx [4], [9]–[11]. Since repression of crystallin genes was shown to be independent of the transactivation domain of Pax6, it was proposed that inhibition is mediated by competition for promoter occupancy with other TFs [4], [9], [10]. However, additional mechanisms of Pax6-dependent gene repression remain to be identified.
1261 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) direct post-transcriptional repression of a wide array of genes by adhering to miRNA-specific sequences in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs [12]. In this way, a single type of miRNA can essentially bind dozens of different mRNA transcripts [13]. Therefore, regulation of a miRNA gene by a tissue-specific TF can facilitate the down-regulation of batteries of genes.
1262 To ascertain the roles of miRNAs in eye development, somatic mutations of the miRNA-maturation enzyme gene Dicer1 were examined in the mouse lens and retinal progenitors cells (RPCs, [14]–[16]). When Dicer1 was knocked out at the lens placode (LP) stage, lens development proceeded to primary lens fiber cell differentiation; however, secondary lens fiber cell differentiation was aborted and lens epithelium (LE) cells ceased to divide, undergoing apoptosis. Therefore, it is evident that miRNAs play an important role in the late stages of lens development. Somatic mutation of Dicer1 in RPCs revealed multiple activities of miRNAs in their specification, differentiation and survival [15], [16].
1263 To date, there is limited information on the function of specific miRNAs in the eye. Probably the most extensively studied example is miR-204. In medaka fish (Oryzias latipes; ol), ol-miR-204 was shown to affect lenticular and retinal development via repression of Meis2 and its transcriptional target Pax6 [17]. In addition, miR-204 was found to contribute to the epithelial physiology of human retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) [18], [19]. However, the activity and regulation of miR-204 in the mammalian lens and retina remain unknown. The coding region for the mouse miR-204 resides in intron 6 of the transient receptor potential cation channel M3 gene (Trpm3 [20]). miR-204 appears to be concomitantly expressed with Trpm3 in the eye and CNS [18], [21], [22]. In the post-natal mouse eye, its pattern resembles that of Pax6 (Figure 1;[21], [23]).

1266 Trpm3/miR-204 expression is dependent on Pax6 activity during eye development.
1267 The present study was aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanism of Pax6-dependent transcriptional repression through unbiased analysis of up-regulated genes in Pax6-mutant lenses. We show that inhibition of gene expression by Pax6 is at least partly mediated through direct activation of miR-204. In addition, we identify Sox11 as a novel target for miR-204 in lens and retinal development. Finally, both regulation of Trpm/miR-204 by Pax6 and inhibition of Sox11 are shown to be conserved in vertebrates. This study is the first to reveal that miRNAs are part of the Pax6 genetic network in different vertebrate species, adding to the known repertoire of Pax6 activities in the course of organ development.

1269 Results
1270 Large-scale changes in the lens transcriptome as a result of Pax6 deletion
1271 To identify new Pax6 genetic targets in the developing lens, an expression microarray was performed on embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) lenses from controls and somatic mutants of Pax6 (Pax6loxP/loxP;Mlr10-cre, [24]). Out of 28,853 mouse genes, 315 were altered at a cutoff of 2.0-fold and a P-value below 0.05. Of these, the expression levels of 235 genes were increased upon Pax6 deletion, while only 83 genes were reduced (P-values and fold change are shown Figure S1 and the genes are listed in Table S1). A bias toward up-regulated genes - 2.8[ratio]1 in the lens, has also been reported in the embryonic neocortex (1.8[ratio]1, 600 up-regulated vs. 339 down-regulated genes; [25]). This raised the possibility of Pax6's role in directly or indirectly repressing the expression of a large number of genes.
1272 To identify common targets of Pax6, we compared the list of altered genes in the lens and embryonic neocortex [25]. Interestingly, only 22 genes were found to be regulated similarly in both systems, with 18 up-regulated and 4 down-regulated in both the lens and neocortex (Table 1). The four genes that were down-regulated in both lens and neuronal lineages are potential direct transcriptional targets of Pax6. One of these - Trpm3 - contains both a coding region for Trpm3 and a non-coding miR-204 sequence. Trpm3 is a melastatin-like cation channel which is sensitive to steroids, active in insulin-producing beta cells and a chemo- and thermosensor in the somatosensory system [20], [26], [27], while miR-204 has been documented to play a role in ocular lineages in fish and mammals [17], [18] and thus may mediate Pax6's inhibitory activity in the eye.

1276 Pax6 is required for Trpm3/miR-204 expression during lens development
1277 Trpm3 transcript distribution in the post-natal eye shows some overlap with Pax6 expression [18], [21], [22]. Considering the possibility that Pax6 regulates Trpm3 expression directly during eye development, we compared the spatio-temporal expression patterns of Pax6 protein and Trpm3 mRNA during eye morphogenesis and differentiation (Figure 1). Pax6 expression initiates in the neural tube on around E8.5 [28]. On E9.5, Pax6 is detected in the ocular progenitors of the optic vesicle (OV) and LP (Figure 1A). On E9.5, Trpm3 is not yet detected in most ocular progenitors cells, and is barely observed in a small population of cells in the dorsal OV (Figure 1B, asterisk). Expression of Trpm3 on E9.5 was, however, evident in the otic vesicle, the primordium of the inner ear (Figure 1B′ inset). In contrast, from E10.5 onwards, Trpm3 mRNA was co-expressed with Pax6 protein in the lens and optic cup (OC) lineages. Both were strongly expressed in the invaginating lens vesicle and in the inner and outer layers of the OC (Figure 1C, 1D). Trpm3 expression seemed to be restricted to the developing eye, inner ear and choroid plexus and did not extend to Pax6-positive cells of the developing diencephalon (Figure 1D, Figure S2A). The expression of Trpm3 continued to follow that of Pax6 during later stages of eye development and was detected in the inner nuclear layer and ciliary body after birth (Figure 1E, 1G; Figure S2B). Therefore, Trpm3 expression in the developing eye began only after the establishment of ocular progenitor domains. From that stage onwards, Trpm3 expression recapitulated the complex ocular pattern of Pax6 expression, suggesting that Pax6 regulates Trpm3 expression in the developing lens and OC derivatives.
1278 To determine whether Pax6 simultaneously regulates Trpm3 and its hosted non-coding miR-204, Pax6 systemic knockout (Pax6lacZ/lacZ, E11.5) and Pax6 lens-specific conditional mutants (Pax6loxP/loxP;Mlr10-cre, E14.5) were examined (Figure 1). On E11.5, both Trpm3 and miR-204 were highly expressed in the lens vesicle and in the outer layer of the OC that contains the progenitors of the RPE, whereas lower levels were detected in the inner OC, where the RPCs reside (Figure 1E, 1I). Upon Pax6 ablation in Pax6lacZ/lacZ knock-out mice, Trpm3/miR-204 expression on E11.5 was lost from the optic rudiment (Figure 1F, 1J). On E14.5, Trpm3 and miR-204 were both detected in the LE and RPE. In the inner layer of the OC, expression was more prominent in the distal regions containing the ciliary body and iris primordia (Figure 1G, 1K). When Pax6 was removed specifically in the lens lineage on E14.5 (Pax6loxP/loxP;Mlr10-cre, [24]), both Trpm3 and miR-204 were lost from the mutant lens (Figure 1H, 1L). A reduction in Trpm3 expression was also detected in Pax6-deficient OC (Pax6loxP/loxP;a-cre [29], see below) and in progenitors of the iris and ciliary body (Pax6loxP/loxP;Dct-Cre mutants, Figure S3). These findings strongly support genetic regulation of Trpm3/miR-204 by Pax6 in several ocular tissue types.

1280 To determine whether Pax6 regulation of the Trpm3/miR-204 gene is direct, we utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to identify the binding region, in conjunction with in-silico TF binding site searches, followed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to precisely locate Pax6 binding sites. The mammalian Trpm3 gene contains three transcription start sites based on the RefSeq data presented in the UCSC genome browser. A preliminary ChIP-on-chip experiment performed using chromatin prepared from E13.5 whole eyes indicated Pax6 binding within the region shown in Figure 2B. To examine whether Pax6 indeed binds to these Trpm3 regulatory sequences in vivo, quantitative ChIP PCR was performed on wild-type P0 lenses using anti-Pax6 antibodies. Two amplicons: A1 (chr19:22,524,578–697) and A2 (chr19:22,525,042–126) within the candidate regulatory region were enriched 16.3-fold (P = 0.0043) and 25.9-fold (P = 0.0098), respectively, compared to an upstream non-specific region (NSR-chr19:NSR-chr19:22,523,967–4079).

1282 Figure 2
1283 Pax6 directly binds a Trpm3 enhancer sequence in vitro and in vivo.
1284 We tested four sequences (Trpm3.1–4) containing putative Pax6 binding sites using EMSA (prediction of target sites was performed as described in [30], EMSA described in [31], and the sequence similarities of Trpm3.1–Trpm3.4 to Pax6 binding matrices are presented in Table S2, Table S3). The probe for Trpm3.4 showed strongest binding to a flag-Pax6 protein containing both the paired domain and homeodomain (Pax6-PD-HD, Figure 2D). Increased concentrations of Pax6 protein produced stronger complex formation, while the presence of cold oligonucleotide competitors inhibited the binding (P6CON, Figure 2D). Therefore, we concluded that Pax6 directly binds Trpm3 regulatory sequences located downstream of the second promoter of Trpm3.
1285 miR-204 binds the 3′ UTR of Sox11 and down-regulates its expression
1286 Since miR-204 is down-regulated in ocular tissues depleted in Pax6, we next examined which downstream genes might be regulated by miR-204 in the developing mouse eye. Since most miRNA target sites can be found in the 3′ UTR segment of the target genes, we searched for putative miR-204 binding sites in the 3′ UTRs of all mouse genes (TargetScan Mouse, www.targetscan.org). From the list of genes containing conserved putative binding sites for miR-204, 35 were found to be up-regulated in the Pax6 mutant lens with at least a 1.5-fold change (Table 2). Statistical analysis revealed significant over-representation of miR-204 target genes among the genes negatively regulated by Pax6 (hypergeometric test, P = 0.019), making them good candidates for miR-204-mediated repression in the developing lens. Of these, Sox11 was selected due to its reported roles in ocular development [32]. Interestingly, Sox11 is encoded by a single exon and a long, 5,301-bp 3′ UTR, and was the only gene from this list that had three highly conserved putative miR-204 target sequences at positions 545–551, 916–923 and 3848–3855 (TargetScan Mouse). Sox11 is a member of the SoxC group of TFs, which are required for neurogenesis in the embryo and adult [33]–[36].

1288 Table 2
1289 Putative miR-204 targets found to be upregulated in Pax6 CKO lenses.
1290 To examine whether miR-204 down-regulates Sox11 expression, we utilized mouse neuroblastoma 2a (Neu-2a) cells, which show high expression of Sox11 [37]. The cells were transfected with either a miR-204 mimic plasmid (miR-204-miRVec) or a scrambled vector (scramble-miRVec) and were examined for Sox11 immunofluorescence. On average, cells transfected with scrambled miRNA had fluorescence levels similar to those of non-transfected cells (1[ratio]1.03, n = 163), whereas cells transfected with miR-204 had significantly lower levels (1[ratio]0.87, n = 150, P = 0.0104, Figure 3A–3C). This was confirmed at the mRNA level in a human lens cell line (H36CE) and mouse Neu-2a transfected with a mimic miR-204 (see below and Figure S8). Therefore, miR-204 is able to down-regulate the level of Sox11 transcript and protein in culture.
1291 Figure 3
1292 Figure 3
1293 miR-204 down-regulates the expression of Sox11.
1294 To determine whether Sox11 down-regulation is a result of direct binding, part of the wild-type 3′ UTR of Sox11, containing the first two putative miR-204 binding sites, was cloned downstream of the luciferase gene and compared to a mutated version of the 3′ UTR. Upon co-transfection of the wild-type Sox11 3′ UTR with miR-204, luciferase activity was reduced by 59% (P = 0.0012). In contrast, when we used a mutated version of the site that had the highest probability of conserved targeting (based on TargetScan version 6.2, position 914–921 on the 3′ UTR), luciferase levels were restored to control levels (96%, P = 0.20, Figure 3D arrow). Therefore, miR-204 binds the 3′ UTR of Sox11 and down-regulates its expression. Several miRNA binding sites on the gene's 3′ UTR usually exhibit additive effects ([38]). Yet, in the case of Sox11, mutating one site was sufficient to rescue most of the effect of miR-204. This reveals the importance of this site for the regulation of Sox11, although the other sites may contribute as well.
1295 Pax6 negatively controls Sox11 expression in vivo in the lens and retina
1296 Sox11 has been shown to be required for ocular development in mice. In Sox11−/− mutant embryos, the OC fails to close, resulting in a coloboma, a folded retina and a small lens that remains attached to the cornea [32]. This phenotype is reminiscent of heterozygous Pax6 mutations, suggesting a positive interaction between Pax6 and Sox11 in the context of early eye development [32]. However, we did not detect reduced expression of Sox11 transcript in Pax6lacZ/lacZ embryos in the OV or SE on E9.5 (Figure S4). Therefore, while both Pax6 and Sox11 are required for lens vesicle detachment and OC morphogenesis, Pax6 is not required for the expression of Sox11.
1297 In contrast, we identified a negative regulatory interaction between Pax6 and Sox11 at later stages of eye development as observed by the 2.3-fold elevation in Sox11 revealed by the microarray results above. To validate these findings, we characterized Sox11 expression in control and Pax6loxP/loxP;Mlr10-cre eyes on E14.5. In the wild-type, Sox11 transcripts were detected in the retina but not in the LE, in agreement with previous reports (Figure 3E, 3H, [32]). In contrast to previous studies, which utilized a lacZ reporter [32],[39], we did not detect Sox11 transcript in the lens fiber cells (E14.5, Figure 3E). This up-regulation of the lacZ reporter may be due to loss of miR-204 binding sites within the 3′ UTR, which were replaced with the lacZ gene, or to persistence of β-galactosidase protein in the slow-metabolizing lens fibers. Sox11 mRNA was elevated at the equator of Pax6loxP/loxP;Mlr10-cre lenses (Figure 3I, arrowheads), similar to the area of elevation seen with Sox2 [24] and Sox9 (Figure S5) in Pax6 mutant lenses. The elevation of Sox11 transcript in the Pax6loxP/loxP;Mlr10-cre lens validates Pax6's negative regulation of Sox11 in the lens.
1298 Trpm3/miR-204 is expressed in the progenitors of the OC and similar to Pax6, its expression is higher in the peripheral region of the OC, which is populated by the progenitors of the iris and ciliary body (Figure 1C, 1G, 1K and Figure 3G). While Sox11 is also expressed in the OC, its expression is lowest in the iris and ciliary body progenitors (not shown), intermediate in the neuroblastic layer (NBL) and highest in the ganglion cell layer (Figure 3H). We next examined whether Pax6 may also function in the OC to modulate Sox11 using Pax6loxP/loxP;a-Cre embryos [29]. In the region depleted of Pax6 (Figure 3J, dotted lines), Trpm3 was reduced (Figure 3K, dotted lines), while in the same region, Sox11 transcript level was markedly elevated (Figure 3L, small asterisk in area demarcated by dotted lines). The area of elevation corresponded to the Pax6−;Crx− population of RPCs in mutated Pax6loxP/loxP;a-Cre retinas [11].
1299 Therefore, Pax6 down-regulates the expression of Sox11 in progenitors of the lens and in a subclass of RPCs. Combined with the results above, these findings suggest that Pax6 modulates Sox11 via miR-204-based repression.
1300 Pax6 regulation of Trpm/miR-204 is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates
1301 As miR-204 was previously shown to be expressed and to regulate eye morphogenesis in medaka fish [17], we hypothesized that Pax6 regulation of medaka miR-204 is evolutionarily conserved.
1302 Interestingly, while ol-Trpm3 is not expressed in the medaka at stage 24 (st 24), the expression of ol-Trpm1 corresponded with the pattern of expression of murine Trpm3 and miR-204 (mm-Trpm3, Figure 1E and Figure 4A, 4C). The ol-Trpm1 was expressed in the LP, neuroretina, ciliary marginal zone, ciliary body and presumed RPE (Figure 4C, 4F), suggesting that both ol-Trpm3 and ol-Trpm1 may have undergone a process of divergent gene functionalization, a common evolutionary process in teleost species [40]. To identify additional paralogs for both ol-Trpm1 and ol-Trpm3 genes in medaka fish, we used both available ol-Trpm1 (ENSORLT00000009435) and ol-Trpm3 (ENSORLT00000013467) sequences as queries to search public databases for the orthologous genomic locus. This search did not retrieve any additional ol-Trpm1/3 genes in the medaka genome (data not shown). Furthermore, comparison of the protein sequences together with phylogenetic analysis of many known vertebrate Trpm1 and Trpm3 proteins (human, caw, mouse, rat, chicken, Xenopus, zebrafish, Table S6) using PHYLIP package tools [41] identified ol-Trpm1 as more closely related to the mammalian Trpm3 than to mammalian Trpm1 (Figure S6). In support of these data, mouse–medaka comparative genomic analysis using MultiZ and Medaka Chain/Net package at UCSC (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) highlighted the locus for medaka ol-Trpm1 as a possible syntenic region to the mouse Trpm3 locus (Figure S7).
1303 Figure 4
1304 Figure 4
1305 Characterization of the medaka ol-Trpm1/miR-204 regulatory region.
1306 In medaka, ol-miR-204 is located within an ol-Trpm1 intron. Utilizing phylogenetic footprinting in sequences from related species [42], we identified putative Pax6 cis-regulatory elements within the first 1.5 kb upstream of the ol-Trpm1 coding region (Figure 4E). This region included a Pax6 binding site that resembled the Trpm3.4 region bound by Pax6 in vitro (Figure 2B, Figure 4E). To test the regulatory potential of these sequences, the medaka 1.5-kb genomic fragment was amplified and fused with a nuclear EGFP reporter to generate the p-ol-Trpm1P-GFP construct (Figure 4E). p-ol-Trpm1P-GFP was then assayed for possible enhancer activity in medaka embryos [42]. Three stable transgenic p-ol-Trpm1P-GFP lines showed comparable and robust EGFP expression in the developing fish eye in a pattern that mimicked the reported spatio-temporal distribution of the expression pattern of both ol-Trpm1 and miR-204 in medaka ([17], Figure 4D, 4G), at both embryonic (Figure 4C, 4D) and adult (not shown) stages. We thus concluded that this region contains the sequences that mediate Trpm1/miR-204 expression in the medaka fish.
1307 To examine whether Pax6 controls ol-Trpm1/miR-204 expression in vivo, we tested whether over-expression could expand ol-Trpm1/miR-204's expression domains. Injections of murine Pax6 mRNA (75–100 ng/µl) in p-ol-Trpm1P-GFP-transgenic embryos expanded and enhanced EGFP expression in both the lens and ventral retina of the OC (stage 24; Figure 4I, red arrow). Notably, no ectopic EGFP expression was observed in regions other than the retina, supporting tissue-specific Pax6-mediated activation of ol-Trpm1/miR-204 expression. Likewise, Pax6 over-expression in wild-type embryos expanded ol-Trpm1 mRNA distribution (Figure 4H) and increased both miR-204 and ol-Trpm1 transcript levels as detected by quantitative (q) RT-PCR (Figure 4J). In agreement with these results, transient transfection of HeLa cells with murine Pax6 activated a luciferase reporter construct containing the Trpm1P fragment significantly more than the luciferase activity observed in controls (Figure 4K). Collectively, these findings revealed that Pax6 is able to regulate the Trpm1/miR-204 promoter in fish, similar to its regulation of Trpm3/miR-204 in mice.
1308 miR-204 mediates Pax6 suppression of Sox11 and additional genes in the lens and in medaka embryos
1309 To further evaluate the contribution of miR-204 to the phenotype observed following loss of Pax6, we tested the response of a subset of seven additional genes (Cpn8, Satb2, Hcn2, Nfia, Myo10, Fbn2, and Elavl3) that were both up-regulated in Pax6-negative lenses and contained putative miR-204 binding sites in their 3′ UTR (Table 2) to over-expression of hsa-miR-204 mimic. Most of these genes were examined in the human lens H36CE cell line, whereas Elavl3, a member of the Hu family of neuronal RNA binding proteins, was examined in mouse Neu-2a cells (Figure S8) because of its low expression levels in the lens cell line (data not shown). From the eight genes that were tested, including Sox11, six were down-regulated in response to hsa-miR-204 mimic; the five reduced in H36CE cells were also significantly elevated following transfection with hsa-miR-204 inhibitor (Cpn8, Nfia, Myo10, Fbn2, Sox11; Figure 5A). In Neu-2a cells, Elavl3, Sox11 and Myo10 were significantly reduced (Figure S8). Luciferase assay conducted on the Elavl3 3′ UTR further supported direct regulation of Elavl3 by miR-204, and antibody labeling revealed expansion of Elavl3 expression to the posterior lens cells of Pax6loxP/loxP;Mrl10-Cre mutants (Figure S8, [43]).

1311 Figure 5
1312 miR-204 affects expression of multiple genes and mediates Pax6 suppression of gene expression.
1313 As the expression pattern and regulation of miR-204 seem to be conserved between fish and mammals ([17], Figure 4), we also expected conservation of miR-204 activity. To test this, medaka embryos were injected with either hsa-miR-204 mimic for over-expression of miR-204, or with a morpholino (Mo-miR-204) for knock- down of the endogenous hsa-miR-204 [17]. Control embryos were injected with either an unrelated control Caenorhabditis elegans cel-miR-67 mimic or a six-base mismatched morpholino (MM-Mo-miR-204). The expression of ol-Sox11, ol-Nfia, ol-Fbn2, ol-Myo10, and ol-Elavl3 was monitored by qRT-PCR in embryos collected at stage 24, when the ocular phenotype of ol-miR-204 was first documented (Figure 5B, [17]). Ol-Meis2 was also monitored as it is a known target of miR-204 in medaka [17]. ol-Meis2, ol-Sox11, ol-Fbn2 and ol-Myo10 transcripts were significantly reduced following treatment with hsa-miR-204 mimic, by 28±3.7%, 23±2.8%, 43±3,4% and 21±1% relative to the control, respectively (Figure 5B); these genes were up-regulated following treatment with the Mo-miR-204 by 26.5±4.9%, 38.5±7.8%, 21±4% and 29.4±1.1%, respectively, relative to the control (Figure 5B). This finding supports the regulation of ol-Sox11 as well as ol-Myo10, and ol-Fbn2 by miR-204 in medaka, similar to the regulatory interaction observed in mammals.
1314 We next examined Pax6 regulation of ol-Sox11, ol-Fbn2 and ol-Myo10. Injection of mouse Pax6 mRNA into medaka embryos resulted in reduced expression of these three genes compared with control embryos injected with EGFP mRNA (ol-Sox11 was reduced to 45±5.1%, ol-Myo10 was reduced to 43±6.3%, and ol-Fbn2 to 56.4±2.1% Figure 5C). This reduction was significantly alleviated when embryos were co-injected with Mo-miR-204 (ol-Sox11 was rescued by 28.5±1%, ol-Myo10 by 26±3%, and ol-Fbn2 by 18.4±1.4%) (Figure 5C), indicating that at least part of the repression is mediated through miR-204 activity.
1315 Collectively, and similar to mammals, the expression of ol-Sox11, ol-Fbn2 and ol-Myo10 is negatively regulated by Pax6 and ol-miR-204 in medaka fish. These findings reveal several novel targets of miR-204 in the lens and demonstrate how Pax6 direct control of miR-204 can simultaneously inhibit multiple genes, thus tightly regulating normal lens fate and physiology.

1317 Discussion
1318 In this paper we establish Pax6 as an indirect negative regulator of gene expression through miR-204. We demonstrate that Pax6 regulation of miR-204 is conserved in vertebrates through regulation of the host gene Trpm3 in mice and ol-Trpm1 in medaka. The study identifies several targets of miR-204 repression in the lens, among them Sox11, an important factor for eye and CNS development. Additional new targets for miR-204 include neuronal factors and genes involved in cell motility. Pax6 regulation of miR-204 explains part of the complex and divergent inhibitory activity of Pax6 in ocular progenitor cells, which is required to establish and maintain the identity of ocular tissues.
1319 miR-204 in ocular physiology and development
1320 In mammals, miR-204 has a closely related paralog the miR-211. miR-204 and miR-211 differ by one or two nucleotides, depending on the species. However, they have the same seed-region sequence. Classified as a subfamily of miRNAs, they show the same set of predicted targets (TargetScan [12]). Interestingly, miR-211 first appears in mammals through the evolution of one of the two copies of miR-204, which is present in two identical copies in the genomes of early vertebrates and fish, including medaka fish [17]. In future studies it would be of interest to distinguish the different expression pattern of Trpm1/3 paralog genes and the functional activity of their hosted miRNAs in the different lineages.
1321 The roles of miR-204 in the eye have been recently examined using a primary culture of human fetal RPE. In those cells, miR-204 was shown to down-regulate levels of TgfbR2 and Snai2, genes known to be involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT, [18]). The authors provided evidence of this regulation helping to maintain epithelial phenotype and prevent EMT of the RPE [18]. EMT is characteristic of TGFβ-induced anterior subcapsular cataract formation, a pathology also associated with reduced dosage of Pax6 [44]–[46]. Interestingly, secondary cataract has recently been associated with alterations in miR-204 expression [47]. With this in mind, it is possible that part of Pax6's activity in inhibiting cataract formation is mediated by the activity of miR-204 in the lens and that restoration of miR-204 levels may prevent anterior subcapsular cataract formation.
1322 In addition, the novel miR-204 targets in lens development uncovered here include genes involved in cell motility Myo10 [48], cell matrix and regulation of the TGFβ pathway Fbn2 [49], and genes that function in neuronal or glia cells Sox11 [37], Elavl3 [43], Cpne8 [50] and Nfia [51]. The identification of multiple genes responding to miR-204, and the finding that some of these targets are conserved among vertebrates (Sox11, Fbn2, Myo10), suggest a major effect of miR-204 in regulating LE fate and cell behavior. Future studies should evaluate the contribution of each of the identified targets to maintaining lens physiology (Figure 6). Furthermore, as miR-204 is expressed in several epithelial tissues that originate from the neuroectoderm, including the ciliary body, iris and choroid plexus, it is possible that miR-204 plays a more general role in maintenance of a non-neuronal fate of various epithelia within the CNS.

1325 Model of Pax6 genetic regulation of Sox11 during ocular development.
1326 miR-204 was found to negatively regulate the expression of ol-Meis2 in the eye of medaka fish [17]. Murine Meis1 and Meis2 have been found to be upstream regulators of Pax6 during induction of the LP [52]. It was therefore proposed that miR-204 regulates ol-Pax6 in the lens through regulation of ol-Meis2 [17]. The findings presented here suggest a negative feedback loop between Meis1/2, Pax6 and miR-204 (Figure 6). This regulatory loop may only be relevant at early stages of lens development, because in the mouse lens, Meis1 and Meis2 expression is lost before E12.5 [53], whereas Pax6 and miR-204 expression is maintained throughout development (Figure 1). Further analysis is required to substantiate the relevance of the miR-204–Meis1/2–Pax6 feedback loop in maintaining correct Pax6 dosage during early stages of lens development.
1327 Pax6 regulation of neuronal SOX genes
1328 A previous global analysis of gene expression revealed a significant number of neuron-specific genes that are up-regulated in Pax6-heterozygous lenses [31]. This raised the hypothesis that Pax6 has a dual role: promoting lenticular genes, while simultaneously suppressing competing programs, such as neural development [31]. The altered expression profile in the Pax6-null embryonic lens reported here further revealed over-representation of neurogenic genes using several tools for seeking gene-ontology enrichment DAVID, (NIH, [54]), Expander (Tel-Aviv University, [55]), GATHER (Duke University, [56]) and Ontologizer2.0 (Computational Biology Group, [57]). Among these, four SOX members—Sox2, Sox6, Sox9 and Sox11—were up-regulated upon Pax6 deletion. All four are required for nervous system development [33], [34], [58]–[64]. Three of these genes were found to be regulated by Pax6 at the late stages of lens development in situ: Sox2 [24], Sox11 (Figure 3) and Sox9 (Figure S5). The propensity for Pax6 to repress SOX genes in the lens could be a way of silencing competing genetic programs.
1329 In this paper, we focused on the regulatory interaction between Pax6 and Sox11 to determine the mechanism underlying Pax6 inhibitory activity during organ formation. In the eye, Sox11 is required for normal development of both lens and retina [32]. The expression of Sox11 in the lens overlaps with that of Pax6 during the early LP stage but is reduced to below detection levels by in-situ hybridization (ISH) during the lens vesicle stage (E11, not shown). In contrast, Pax6 expression is maintained in the LE through adulthood. This expression pattern supports negative regulation of Sox11 by Pax6 from the lens vesicle stage onward. The similar phenotypes of Sox11 and Pax6 mutants suggest that during early stages of LP formation, Pax6 is a positive regulator of Sox11 [32]. However, our analysis of Sox11 expression in Pax6lacZ/lacZ mutants does not support this notion (Figure S3). The current study provides evidence for inhibition of Sox11 by Pax6, mediated by direct miR-204 repression from the stage at which Trpm3/miR-204 expression begins (Figure 1). We propose that Pax6 initially functions in parallel to Sox11 for growth and morphogenesis of the LP. At later stages, Pax6 is required for the initiation of Trpm3/miR-204 expression in both retinal and lens progenitors. In cells that express miR-204, the regulation of Sox11 by Pax6 becomes inhibitory, contributing to loss of Sox11 expression from the lens fibers (Figure 3 and Figure 6). This is further supported by the observation that over-expression of either Pax6 or miR-204 in medaka, results in reduced expression of Sox11, and that Pax6 inhibition can be rescued by knock-down of miR-204 (Figure 5). Hence, this study reveals a new level of regulatory hierarchy mediated by Pax6 during the acquisition of cell fate.
1330 Combinatorial interactions between miRNAs and TFs have been suggested based on in-silico strategies which identified a prevalent TF-miRNA feed-forward loop in which miRNA and TFs co-regulate target genes, as well as each other [65], [66]. We therefore considered the possibility that Pax6 might negatively regulate Sox11 transcription directly, in addition to repressing expression through miR-204. We did not, however, obtain substantial evidence for this possibility when examining the effects of Pax6 on Sox11 regulatory regions in cell culture (HeLa and 293T cells, D. G., and R. A-P., data not shown). Nevertheless, it is possible that binding sites, other than those tested here, play a role in the regulation of Sox11 by Pax6, and that Pax6 represses Sox11 in the presence of co-factors which are only available in the restricted developmental context of the embryonic lens in vivo.
1331 In the retina, Sox11 exhibits a dynamic pattern of expression. It is expressed in the OV and later in the inner OC. Sox11 levels are lower in RPCs than in post-mitotic neurons in the ganglion cell layer (Figure 3), in accordance with its importance in neurogenic precursors in the CNS along with Sox4 [33], [58]. It is worth noting that while Sox11 is detected in the ganglion cell layer during embryogenesis it is subsequently reduced and is not detected in the postnatal retina (K. G, R. A-P unpublished observation). Pax6 however, is maintained in terminally differentiated ganglion and amacrine cell types. Pax6 may therefore contribute to the down-regulation of Sox11 in neuronal precursors during their terminal differentiation. Pax6 is known to play a dual role in RPCs—down-regulating the cone-rod homeobox gene Crx and maintaining proliferation in the peripheral retina, while maintaining pluripotency of the more central cells of the OC [11], [29]. Therefore, Pax6 regulation of Sox11 during retinogenesis is expected to be part of a larger regulatory network, and may be repressed by miR-204 in only a subset of RPCs.
1332 In conclusion, this study reveals novel involvement of miRNA-based gene repression during lens and retinal development. Pax6, a regulator of multiple processes during eye development, is shown to execute part of its gene regulation through direct activation of miR-204.

1336 The mouse lines employed in this study have been previously described: Pax6loxP [67], Mlr10-cre [68], αCre [29], Pax6lacz [69]. All animal work was conducted according to national and international guidelines and approved by the Tel Aviv University review board.
1337 Statistical analysis
1338 All data were examined using two-tailed student's t-test unless otherwise stated.
1339 Microarray analysis
1340 Pax6loxP/loxP;Mlr10-cre and Pax6loxP/loxP E14.5 lenses were dissected; 20 lenses from each litter were pooled, resulting in three control (Pax6loxP/loxP) and three Pax6loxP/loxP;Mlr10-cre samples. RNA purification was performed using Qiashredder and RNeasy (Qiagen). Total RNA (300 ng) was used to generate sense-strand cDNA, which was fragmented, biotin-labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip 1.0ST microarrays. Microarray analysis was performed using Partek Genomics Suite (Partek Inc., MO, USA; www.partek.com). Differentially expressed genes with P-values lower than 0.05 and with a fold-change cutoff of 1.5 are listed in Table S1.
1341 MiRNA–target enrichment analysis
1342 We calculated the significance of miR-204-target enrichment among the up-regulated genes (fold change >1.5, P-value<0.05, n = 754 genes) using TargetScan Mouse predictions (version 5.2; http://www.targetscan.org/mmu_50/) and the hypergeometric test. The background dataset for the calculation included the differentially expressed genes (fold-change cutoff >1.5 and P-value<0.05, n = 1,013 genes). P-values were corrected using the false discovery rate (FDR) method [70].
1343 Immunofluorescence and ISH on sections
1344 Immunofluorescence analysis was performed on 10-µM paraffin sections or 14-µM frozen sections as described previously [67], using the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-Pax6 (1[ratio]400, Covance, # prb-278b), rabbit anti-Sox9 (1[ratio]200, Chemicon, ab5535), mouse anti-Elavl3 (1[ratio]200, Invitrogen, A21272) and goat anti-CrystallinαA (1[ratio]1,000, Santa Cruz, sc-22389). Secondary antibodies were conjugated to alexa594 donkey anti rabbit/goat (1[ratio]1000, Invitrogen, A-21207/A-11058) or alexa488 donkey anti mouse/goat (1[ratio]1000, Invitrogen, A-21202/A-11055).
1345 mRNA ISH was performed as described previously [71]. Plasmids for antisense transcription were: Trpm3 [21] and Sox11—kindly donated by Kirsten Kuhlbrodt [72]. For miRNA ISH, hsa-miR-204 miRCURY LNA Detection probe (working concentration 1/150 µM/µl, Exiqon, cat number 88076-15) were hybridized to frozen sections as described previously [73].
1346 EMSA
1347 HEK293T cells were transfected with p3Xflag-CMV-10 conjugated to the first 270 amino acids of Pax6 containing PD and HD binding domains. Nuclear extracts were obtained as previously described [74]. Nuclear extract (1 µl) or 1[ratio]10 diluted nuclear extract was incubated for 10 min on ice in 8.5 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 30 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM DTT and 2 µg polydI/dC (Sigma). Binding with 1 µl double-stranded 5′-γ-ATP-labeled probe (30,000 cpm) was performed at room temperature for 20 minutes and 200 ng of “cold” Pax6 consensus site was used for competition (P6CON; Wolf et al., 2009). EMSA probes are listed in Table S2.
1348 Quantitative ChIP
1349 Groups of 400 pooled newborn lenses were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10–15 minutes at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with 0.125 M glycine. The tissues were sonicated in 4 ml lysis buffer (1 mM EDTA pH 8, 0.5 mM EGTA pH 8, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8) by Fisher Sonic Dismembrator Model 500 for 14 min (30 s on/30 s off, amplification = 30%). Aliquots of the sheared chromatin prepared from 40 lenses were incubated with 5 µg rabbit anti-Pax6 antibody (Millipore, Cat# AB2237, epitope C-terminus) bound to 20 µl protein G-coated magnetic beads (Invitrogen). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times and resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 25 mM EDTA supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml RNaseA and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K. After 2 h incubation at 55°C, the cross-linking was reversed by overnight incubation at 65°C. Genomic DNA was eluted into 250 µl of water using QIAquick Spin Gel Purification kit (Qiagen).
1350 Amounts of each specific DNA fragment were determined by real-time qPCR using a standard curve generated for each primer set with 0.04, 0.2, and 1% input DNA samples. The copy number of each DNA fragment was compared to the copy number of that fragment in the input DNA. A control antibody (rabbit IgG, Millipore, Cat# NI01) was included for each set of qPCR experiments. The PCR products were between 80 and 130 bp in length. Primers used for PCR are listed in Table S2. The reactions were analyzed using a 7900 ABI PRISM PCR Instrument and 2× SYBR mix (Applied Biosystems). The parameters were: 95°C/10 min followed by 45 cycles of 94°C/10 s, 60°C/20 s and 72°C/30 s.
1351 Immunofluorescence quantification of protein levels
1352 For Sox11 repression by miR-204, Neuro-2a cells (ATCC) were grown on coverslips in 24-well plates for 24 h and then co-transfected with 500 ng of pCAG-GFP expression plasmid and either 500 ng of scrambled-miRVec or miR-204-miRVec expression plasmid containing the pre-miRNA of miR-204 [75]. Cells were fixed for 5 min in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and then immunolabeled as described previously [37] using goat anti-Sox11 (1[ratio]100, Santa Cruz) and rabbit anti-GFP (1[ratio]500, Rockland Immunochemicals). Cell immunofluorescence was measured using ImageJ (NIH) as described previously [24]. Each pCAG-GFP-positive cell (green channel), co-transfected with either miR-204-miRVec or scrambled-miRVec, was measured for Sox11 fluorescence intensity (red channel). The fluorescence level of each transfected cell was divided by the average (red) fluorescence of non-transfected cells in the same field, resulting in a Sox11 index level for each cell calibrated for random image conditions. Sox11 index levels of all miR-204-miRVec-transfected cells were then compared to those of scrambled-miRVec-transfected controls. Fluorescence was measured blindly for the miR-204-miRVec- or scrambled-miRVec-transfected cells. In all measurements, the cells that had a mega-nucleus or multiple neurites were considered differentiated and were therefore not counted.
1353 Teleost sequence analysis and plasmid construction
1354 The available teleost Trpm1 genomic sequences were retrieved (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) and aligned for putative regulatory modules on the basis of sequence conservation [42]. A 1.5-kb region of ol-Trpm1 genomic sequence containing the start codon using the primers: ol-Trpm1 forward 5′-TGTATCATGAGCCGCTAATG-3′ and ol-Trpm1 reverse 5′-GCAGCACCAGGAGAAGGCTC-3′, was cloned in frame with an EGFP reporter gene into the pSKII-ISceI-EGFP and pGL3 basic vectors [76] to create the Trpm1P:GFP and Trpm1:Luc constructs.
1355 Phylogenetic analysis
1356 Sequence alignments were performed using the VISTA [77] and Multalign programs [78], which are available at the corresponding websites: [http://genome.lbl.gov/vista/index.shtml and [http://bioinfo.genopole-toulouse.prd.fr/multalin/multalin.html]. The criterion used for comparison was a minimum 75% nucleotide identity with a window size of over 100 bp. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the PHYLIP package and the results were plotted using the Tree-view software package as previously described [41]). The syntenic genomic region was analyzed using MultiZ and Medaka Chain/Net package at UCSC (http://genome.ucsc.edu/).
1357 Establishment of transgenic fish lines
1358 The Cab inbred (CI) medaka strain was used throughout this study and aged with Iwamatsu staging [79]. Transgenesis and live EGFP monitoring was performed as described previously [42]. Three independent stable transgenic lines were generated for the tested construct.
1359 mRNA injection of medaka embryos
1360 In-vitro synthesis of mouse Pax6 mRNA (cDNA from [80]) was performed as described previously [76]. Pax6 mRNA was injected at 50–200 ng/µl to observe dose-dependent phenotypes. Selected working concentrations were 75–100 ng/µl. Control embryos were injected with 15 ng/µl of EGFP mRNA [76].
1361 Cell transfection and luciferase assays
1362 For miRNA-repression studies (Figure 3D), a 506-bp fragment of the Sox11 3′ UTR (spanning two miR-204 binding sites) or 484 bp of Elavl3's 3′ UTR was amplified by PCR from mouse brain cDNA and XhoI–NotI restriction sites were added with the following primers: Sox11 (F) 5′-ACACTCGAGCTGTTACTCTAGGGAGTTGA-3′ and (R) 5′-AAGGTCAAGCGGCCGCAAAGGGAAGAAGTGCCTGAA-3; Elavl3 (F) 5′-ACACTCGAGCAATGGTGCCCTACTCAGG-3′ and (R) 5′-AGGTCAAGCGGCCGCTTCCTGTGGCCATGTTTGCT-3′.
1363 The 3′ UTRs were cloned downstream of the Renilla luciferase reporter (psiCHECK™-2, Promega). For site-directed mutation, the miR-204 binding site on the 3′ UTRs (second binding site for Sox11), was mutated by PCR with PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA Polymerase (Genex). The mutagenesis primers were: Sox11 (F) 5′-TTTGTACAGTGAAAATCTCACAATCTTGCTGTGT-3′; Elavl3 (F) 5′-CTATTTTTGTAAAAACTCCAAAAGACCTCGTGGA-3′ and complementary reverse primers. Products were then incubated with DPN1 (New England BioLabs) for digestion of the source plasmid. Co-transfection of miRVec-miR-204 [75] and the Renilla-3′ UTR plasmid was in HEK293T cells with TransIT-LT1 Transfection Reagent (Mirus). After 48 h, firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System.
1364 Regulation of promoter activity in cell culture (Figure 4K) was performed in HeLa cells. Cells were co-transfected with the construct (100 ng), expression vector pcDNA3/Pax6 (100 ng) and RL-TK plasmid with Renilla luciferase (10 ng) as a transfection-efficiency control. Transfection was performed using Fugene Transfection Reagent (Roche) following the manufacturer's protocol [76]. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Reporter activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Each assay was performed in duplicate, with three biological repeats.
1365 For functional studies of miR-204 in cell culture (Figure 5A, Figure S8) the human lens cell line H36CE (Porter et al. 1998) was transfected and qRT-PCR experiments were performed as described [81]. H36CE cells were transfected with either 50 nM miRIDIAN™ Dharmacon microRNA Mimics (hsa-miR-204 mimic or control cel-miR-67) or 80 nM miRIDIAN™ Dharmacon microRNA Inhibitor (hsa-miR-204 inhibitor or negative control cel-miR-67). Neu-2a cells were transfected using HiPerFect (Qiagen) with hsa-miR-204 mimic (Ambion) or miR negative control (Applied Biosystems) oligonucleotide. The isolation of RNA and qRT-PCR for detection of miR-204 were as previously described [82]. Total cDNA was generated using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and qRT-PCR was performed with FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Roche). Primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in Table S4 and sequences of for functional studies of miR204 are listed in Table S5.
1366 qRT–PCR analysis of gene expression in injected embryos
1367 At least 250 embryos were pooled in each assay. cDNA synthesis was performed using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR using random hexamers (Invitrogen). ol-Hprt was used as the endogenous control as previously described [17]. Detection of miR-204 was performed by TaqMan MicroRNA Assays (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's protocol. Each assay was performed in duplicate. Primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in Table S4.

1526 Abstract
1527 Stem cell pluripotency, angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) have been shown to be significantly upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and many other aggressive cancers. The dysregulation of these processes is believed to play key roles in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis, and is contributory to PDAC being the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US. The tumor suppressor miRNA miR-145 downregulates critical pluripotency factors and oncogenes and results in repressed metastatic potential in PDAC. Additionally, the miR-200 family regulates several angiogenic factors which have been linked to metastasis in many solid tumors. We have previously demonstrated that downregulation of DCLK1 can upregulate critical miRNAs in both in vitro and in vivo cancer models and results in downregulation of c-MYC, KRAS, NOTCH1 and EMT-related transcription factors. A recent report has also shown that Dclk1 can distinguish between normal and tumor stem cells in Apcmin/+ mice and that ablation of Dclk1+ cells resulted in regression of intestinal polyps without affecting homeostasis. Here we demonstrate that the knockdown of DCLK1 using poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-encapsulated-DCLK1-siRNA results in AsPC1 tumor growth arrest. Examination of xenograft tumors revealed, (a) increased miR-145 which results in decreased pluripotency maintenance factors OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4 as well as KRAS and RREB1; (b) increased let-7a which results in decreased pluripotency factor LIN28B; and (c) increased miR-200 which results in decreased VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and EMT-related transcription factors ZEB1, ZEB2, SNAIL and SLUG. Specificity of DCLK1 post-transcriptional regulation of the downstream targets of miR-145, miR-200 and let-7a was accomplished utilizing a luciferase-based reporter assay. We conclude that DCLK1 plays a significant master regulatory role in pancreatic tumorigenesis through the regulation of multiple tumor suppressor miRNAs and their downstream pro-tumorigenic pathways. This novel concept of targeting DCLK1 alone has several advantages over targeting single pathway or miRNA-based therapies for PDAC.

1529 Introduction
1530 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. annually with a 5% 5-year survival rate. Despite more than 10 years of FDA-approved therapeutic regimens and marked improvements in medical and surgical care, no significant impact on PDAC patient survival has been observed [1]. Recently, a subset of cells with cancer stem-cell (CSC) properties has been identified in PDAC [2] that are capable of unlimited self-renewal and give rise to more-differentiated and more-aggressive progeny, which are often resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy [2,3]. The inability to eradicate these CSCs is postulated to be a reason for tumor relapse, metastasis and death following initial responses to treatment [4]. Another critical obstacle in combating solid tumor cancers in general is the heterogeneity of cell types within the tumor microenvironment [5] and the highly desmoplastic tumor niche [6]. This heterogeneity is further complicated by epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that plays a key role in cancer invasion and metastasis [7,8]. Many of the EMT-inducing transcription factors such as SNAI1 (SNAIL), SNAI2 (SLUG), ZEB1, ZEB2, TWIST1, FOXC2 and Goosecoid have been associated with tumor invasion and metastasis [9]. Recently, a number of reports have identified the microRNA (miRNA) miR-200 family as fundamental markers and regulators of EMT [10–12]. miRNAs are small, 19–22 nucleotide long, non-coding RNAs that inhibit gene expression at the posttranscriptional level [13]. A strong link between miRNA dysregulation and human cancer has been established [14]. Consequently miRNAs have been demonstrated to act either as oncogenes (e.g., miR-155, miR-17−5p and miR-21) [15,16] or tumor suppressors (e.g., miR-34, miR-15a, miR-16−1 and let-7) [17–20]. However, the precise regulatory features that tip the balance towards a cancer phenotype with respect to tumor suppressor versus oncogenic miRNA expression are poorly understood.
1531 Pluripotency is the ability of a cell to differentiate into any cell type and is a unique characteristic of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Pluripotency transcription factors such as OCT4, SOX2, NANOG and KLF4 form regulatory networks and influence a wide spectrum of downstream genes. Overexpression of these factors can dedifferentiate human and mouse somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [21]. The reprogramming factors OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4, c-MYC, and LIN28 have also been suggested to be oncogenes and may be implicated in the development of several cancers [21–26]. Multiple reports have shown that these transcription factors are regulated, at least in part, by miRNAs [21,27,28]. miR-145 specifically inhibits the aforementioned pluripotency factors by binding the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA, which leads to inhibition of ESCs, self-renewal, and induction of differentiation. Furthermore, loss of miR-145 impairs differentiation and elevates OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 [21]. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the miR-145 promoter is bound and repressed by OCT4 in ESCs. This indicates (a) the existence of a direct link between the core reprogramming factors and miR-145, and (b) the presence of a double-negative feedback loop involving OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and miR-145 [21]. In cancer, miR-145 is downregulated and has been demonstrated to possess tumor suppressor properties. The loss of miR-145 (miR-143/145 cluster) is observed in KRAS mutated pancreatic cancers, and therapeutic restoration of these miRNAs abrogates tumorigenesis [29,30]. Furthermore, Ras-responsive element binding protein 1 (RREB1) represses miR-143/miR-145 promoter activity, which indicates that repression is an early event in pancreatic cancer initiation and progression [29]. Additionally, KRAS and RREB1 are targets of miR-143/145, demonstrating a feed-forward mechanism that potentiates RAS signaling-mediated PDAC tumor progression [29]. It has been recently demonstrated that ectopic expression of miR-143/145 results in repressed metastasis and increased adhesion of pancreatic cancer cells [30]. These data taken together suggest that miR-145 is a master regulator of iPSCs factors in ESCs and CSCs and may play an important role in inhibition of pancreatic cancer initiation, progression and EMT.
1532 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling plays an important role in tumor angiogenesis. VEGF family members mediate the critical signaling by binding to two tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. VEGFR1 is required for endothelial cell survival; whereas, VEGFR2 is required for receptor-mediated angiogenic and vascular permeability activity [31–33]. Recently it has been demonstrated that these angiogenic factors (VEGFR1 and 2) are involved in tumor metastasis of renal and colon carcinoma cells [34]. VEGF signaling is known to promote tumor vasculature and endothelial cell proliferation in PDAC. Studies using soluble VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 (inhibition of VEGFR-mediated signaling in a dominant-negative manner) or the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors resulted in inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, growth and metastasis in PDAC mouse models [35–38].
1533 DCLK1 (formerly known as DCAMKL-1) is a putative intestinal and pancreatic stem cell marker and is upregulated in the stroma and epithelium of PDAC. It has also recently been described as a marker of the relatively undefined tuft/brush cell in the pancreas and intestine [39,40]. It negatively regulates several tumor suppressor miRNAs and likely plays a key role in initiation and progression of solid tumor cancers [11,41]. In addition, it regulates several key oncogenes (c-MYC, KRAS and NOTCH1) and EMT. Moreover, overexpression of pluripotency factors in liver cancer cells resulted in increased expression of DCLK1 [42]. Recently Nakanishi et al. [43], have used an elegant Dclk1-Cre mouse model to demonstrate, that Dclk1 marks intestinal tumor stem cells. Ablation of Dclk1 expressing cells in Apcmin/+ mice resulted in regression of polyps without any damage to the normal intestinal epithelium. In this report, following the knockdown of DCLK1 using nanoparticle-encapsulated siRNA (NPsiDCLK1) in tumor xenografted mice, we observed a significant increase in: (A) miR-143/145 cluster, which resulted in downregulation of key pluripotency markers (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and NANOG); (B) let-7a, which resulted in decreased pluripotency factor LIN28B; and (C) miR-200a, b and c, which resulted in downregulation of EMT and angiogenic factors. Administration of NPsiDCLK1 did not result in overt toxicity in mice. These data taken together suggest a central regulatory role of DCLK1 in pancreatic tumorigenesis.

1535 Materials and Methods
1536 Small interfering RNAs
1537 DCLK1 siRNA (siDCLK1) sequence targeting the coding region of DCLK1 (accession No. NM_004734) (GGGAGUGAGAACAAUCUACtt) and scrambled siRNAs (si-SCR) not matching any of the human genes were obtained (Ambion Inc, Austin, TX).
1538 Synthesis and characterization of DCLK1 siRNA NPs
1539 Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) acid nanoparticles (PLGA NPs) were synthesized using a double emulsion solvent evaporation technique as described earlier [11,44]. Briefly, siRNA (DCLK1 or scrambled) was condensed on the cationic polymer poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) to form an siRNA-PEI complex. This complex was added to PLGA in chloroform and vortexed and transferred to 2% polyvinyl alcohol. This emulsion was sonicated and allowed to evaporate overnight. The size, polydispersity index, and zeta-potential measurements of synthesized siRNA NPs were determined using diffraction light scattering (DLS) utilizing Zeta PALS (Brookhaven Instruments, Holtsville, NY).
1540 Xenograft tumor model
1541 NOD/SCID mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine) and housed in pathogen-free conditions. They were cared for in accordance with guidelines set forth by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps’ “Policy on Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals." All studies were approved and supervised by the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). AsPC-1 cells (1 × 107) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 4- to 6-wk-old mice (n=3). Tumors were measured using a caliper and the volume was calculated as (length × width2) × 0.5. The tumors were palpable 30 days after injection of cells. NPs were reconstituted in sterile normal saline and injected directly into the tumors. Each animal bearing the tumor was injected on days 30, 33, 36, 39, and 42 with one of the following preparations -50 µl (5 µM) of siRNA-NP preparation [NP alone (Control), NP-siScrambled (NPsiSCR), or NPsiDCLK1]. All mice were killed on day 45.
1542 Immunohistochemistry, Western blot, real-time reverse Transcription-PCR, miRNA analysis, Invasion assay and luciferase reporter gene assay
1543 These analyses were carried out as previously described [11,41]. Detailed descriptions are provided in the Supplementary section of Materials and Methods (Text S1).

1546 RNA silencing of DCLK1 inhibits pancreatic cancer xenograft growth
1547 AsPC-1 human pancreatic cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of NOD/SCID mice and tumors were allowed to develop for 30 days. NP encapsulated siRNAs (NPsiDCLK1 and NPsiSCR) were injected intratumorally. Nanoparticle encapsulation was performed to overcome the theoretical limitations of siRNA-based delivery [45]. The efficacy of this approach has been previously tested in colorectal cancer xenografts [11]. On day 30, when the tumors were palpable, the treatments were initiated and continued every third day for a total of five injections. Tumors were excised at day 45, and the tumor volumes are represented in Figure 1. Administration of NPsiDCLK1 resulted in a significant (~85%) reduction (p < 0.01) in tumor volume compared with either the Control (NPs-alone) or NPsiSCR-treated tumors (Figure 1A and 1B). mRNA analysis demonstrated a significant downregulation (p < 0.01) of DCLK1 mRNA compared to Control or NPsiSCR treated tumors (Figure 1C). These data taken together demonstrate that inhibition of DCLK1 results in AsPC-1 tumor xenograft growth arrest.

1550 DCLK1 is essential for human pancreatic tumor xenograft growth.
1551 Knockdown of DCLK1 results in downregulation of pluripotency factors in pancreatic tumor xenografts via miR-145
1552 It has been demonstrated that OCT4, SOX2, c-MYC, LIN28, NANOG and KLF4 are required for ESC self-renewal and pluripotency and are upregulated in some aggressive cancers and in CSCs [23–26,28]. Overexpression of these factors can reprogram or dedifferentiate human and mouse somatic cells into iPSCs. Here we observed a significant (p < 0.01) downregulation (>40%) in the mRNA expression of pluripotency markers NANOG and KLF4 (Figure 2A and 2B) by real-time RT-PCR following the knockdown of DCLK1. Similarly NANOG and KLF4 proteins were also downregulated as analyzed by immunohistochemical analysis (Figure 2C and 2D). Additionally, we also observed a significant (>40%) downregulation of OCT4 (Figure 2E) and SOX2 (Figure 2F) at the mRNA level following the knockdown of DCLK1 in AsPC-1 tumor xenografts.

1555 DCLK1 regulates pluripotency.
1556 DCLK1 post-transcriptionally regulates miR-145 in pancreatic cancer
1557 miR-145 has been shown to repress OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4, thereby repressing pluripotency and controlling differentiation [21]. miR-145 is downregulated in various cancers and has been demonstrated to possess tumor suppressor and metastasis inhibitory properties [29,30]. Earlier reports [11,28,41] and the data presented above indicate that DCLK1 negatively regulates tumor suppressor miRNAs like let-7a, miR-144 and miR-200a. Similarly, here we observed a significant induction (1.5-fold) of pri-miR-143/145 cluster miRNA (Figure 3A) and pri-miR-145 miRNA (Figure 3B) following the knockdown of DCLK1 in AsPC-1 tumor xenografts. Furthermore, we performed a luciferase reporter gene assay to quantitatively measure the effect of DCLK1 knockdown on miR-145 miRNA. AsPC-1 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the firefly luciferase gene with a complementary miR-145 binding site at the 3' UTR. Following transfection, cells were treated with NPs alone, NPsiSCR, or NPsiDCLK1 and were subjected to luciferase activity measurement. A reduction in luciferase activity was observed in cells treated with NPsiDCLK1 compared to the control or NPsiSCR (Figure 3C). These data suggest that knockdown of DCLK1 results in downregulation of miR-145 miRNA downstream targets in pancreatic cancer cells. It has been previously demonstrated that a feedback loop mechanism exists between miR-143/145 and KRAS and RREB1. RREB1 is known to repress the transcription of miR-143/145 by binding to its promoter region. Additionally, KRAS and RREB1 are downstream targets of miR-143/145 [29]. Knockdown of DCLK1 resulted in increased expression of miR-143/145 cluster and downregulation of its downstream target KRAS (Figure 3D). Furthermore, we found that the expression of RREB1 was significantly downregulated following the administration of siRNA against DCLK1 (Figure 3E). With these data, we speculate that DCLK1 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation of miR-143/145 cluster and thereby downregulates KRAS and RREB1 in pancreatic tumor xenografts.

1559 Figure 3
1560 DCLK1 negatively regulates miR-143/145.
1561 Overall, these data taken together demonstrate a potential regulatory role for DCLK1 in the expression of iPSC factors in pancreatic cancers via miR-145 miRNA.
1562 DCLK1 regulates let-7a and its downstream target LIN28B in pancreatic cancer
1563 In pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells, we have previously demonstrated that DCLK1 negatively regulates miRNA let-7a. siRNA-mediated knockdown of DCLK1 resulted in downregulation of let-7a downstream targets c-MYC and KRAS. In pancreatic tumor xenografts treated with NPsiDCLK1, we observed a significant upregulation of let-7a (Figure 4A) and subsequent downregulation of its downstream target c-MYC (mRNA and protein) (Figure S1). Reports suggests that LIN28B, a pluripotency maintenance factor regulates miRNA let-7 and in turn let-7 regulates LIN28B (due to the presence of binding site in the 3’ UTR of LIN28B), which suggests a double negative feedback loop between LIN28 and let-7 [46,47]. Here we wanted to see whether NPsiDCLK1 regulates downstream targets of let-7a miRNA. AsPC-1 cells were transfected with plasmid encoding firefly luciferase gene under the control of 3’ UTR containing binding site for let-7. Following the transfection, the cells were treated with NPsiDCLK1 and subjected to luciferase measurement. Following the knockdown of DCLK1, we observed a significant downregulation of let-7-dependent luciferase activity (Figure 4B) indicating that NPsiDCLK1 regulates downstream targets of let-7 in pancreatic cancer cells. Based on real-time RT-PCR analysis of tumors treated with NPsiDCLK1, we observed a significant downregulation of LIN28B mRNA compared to NPsiSCR or control-treated tumors (Figure 4C). These data indicate that DCLK1 regulates LIN28B via let-7-dependent mechanism.

1567 DCLK1 regulates miR-200 family genes and EMT in pancreatic cancer
1568 EMT is a highly conserved process, characterized by the phenotypic conversion of epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells [7]. EMT is essential in various process including organ morphogenesis, wound healing, cancer metastasis and tissue remodeling in embryonic development. Recent studies have demonstrated that miR-200a, b and c (miR-200) are known to regulate EMT and angiogenesis [48]. Previous studies have demonstrated that DCLK1 is overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer tissues and co-localizes with SNAIL and SLUG. Following the knockdown of DCLK1, a significant downregulation of ZEB1, ZEB2, SNAIL and SLUG was observed following increased expression of pri-miR-200a in AsPC-1 cancer cells [11]. Similarly in AsPC-1 tumor xenografts, a 2-fold induction of pri-miR-200a (p < 0.01) (Figure 5A) was observed. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate the effect of DCLK1 knockdown on expression of miR-200b and c in AsPC-1 tumor xenografts. Similar to miR-200a, we observed a significant upregulation of miR-200b (1.5-fold) (Figure 5A) and miR-200c (2-fold) (Figure 5A) following the knockdown of DCLK1. Next, we wanted to investigate whether DCLK1 regulates the downstream targets of miR-200. We performed a luciferase reporter assay for miR-200. AsPC-1 cells were transfected separately with plasmids encoding the luciferase gene under the regulation of miRNA binding sites (three plasmids each containing binding sites for miR-200a, b or c) at its 3’ UTR. Following transfection, we treated the cells with NP-siDCLK1. The cell lysates were subjected to luciferase measurement. Following the knockdown of DCLK1, there was a significant downregulation of miR-200a, miR-200b and miR-200c (Figure 5B) mediated luciferase activity. These data indicate that DCLK1 regulates miR-200 and its downstream targets in PDAC. We also observed a subsequent reduction of miR-200 downstream targets ZEB1 and ZEB2 (Figure 5C), SNAIL and SLUG (Figure 5D) following the knockdown of DCLK1 in pancreatic tumor xenografts. Furthermore AsPC-1 cells were treated with NPsiSCR or NPsiDCLK1 and subjected to invasion assay using BD Biosciences Matrigel invasion chambers (BD BioCoatTM). We observed significant inhibition of invasion following the knockdown of DCLK1 (Figure 5E and F). These data taken together indicate that knockdown of DCLK1 inhibits EMT and invasion by regulating miR-200 in human pancreatic tumor xenografts and cancer cells. Similarly to our previous studies, following the knockdown of DCLK1, we also observed inhibition of NOTCH1 via miR-144 (Figure S2) in AsPC-1 tumor xenografts.

1572 DCLK1 regulates angiogenic factors in PDAC
1573 It has been demonstrated that miR-200 inhibits lung adenocarcinoma invasion and metastasis by targeting VEGFR1. A putative binding site for miR-200 was observed in the 3’ UTR of VEGFR1, and it was demonstrated that miR-200 negatively regulates VEGFR1 [48]. Additionally, a recent study demonstrated that VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 has a binding site for miR-200b and based on luciferase-based reporter assay miR-200b regulates these angiogenic factors [49]. These data indicate that VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 are downstream targets of miR-200. Here, we found DCLK1 regulating miR-200 and its downstream targets. We wanted to further investigate the effect of DCLK1 knockdown on angiogenic factors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. We observed a significant downregulation of VEGFR1 mRNA (Figure 6A), protein (Figure 6B and C – left panel) in tumors treated with NPsiDCLK1 compared to control and NPsiSCR treated-tumors. We also observed downregulation of VEGFR2 mRNA (Figure 6E) and protein (Figure 6C – right panel) in pancreatic tumor xenografts treated with NPsiDCLK1. Additionally, we performed luciferase-based reporter assays for VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. AsPC-1 cells were transfected with luciferase gene with VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 3’ UTR, treated with NPsiDCLK1 and subjected to luciferase activity measurement. Following the knockdown of DCLK1, we observed a significant downregulation of VEGFR1 (Figure 6D) and VEGFR2 (Figure 6F) 3’ UTR mediated luciferase activity. These data taken together indicate that DCLK1 regulates VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 via miR-200 in PDAC.

1578 Discussion
1579 miRNAs are rapidly emerging as critical regulators of virtually all key cellular processes. Dysregulation of miRNAs are quite common in many human cancers including PDAC. In many tumors, there is either overexpression of so-called oncogenic miRNAs (e.g., miR-155, miR-17−5p and miR-21) [15,16] or downregulation of tumor suppressor miRNAs (e.g., miR-34, miR-15a, miR-16−1 and let-7) [17–20]. The let-7 and miR-200 families are well-known regulators of key differentiation programs during development. Loss of let-7 in cancer results in progression and dedifferentiation, and the miR-200 family has been shown to be a key regulator of EMT. Furthermore, recent studies have linked let-7 with stem cell maintenance and EMT. Thus it is quite possible that tumor progression may represent a process that results in progressive dedifferentiation (EMT) towards a cell type that has a stem cell-like phenotype. Moreover, this process appears to be tightly regulated by miRNA-dependent mechanisms [10,11,27,30]. DCLK1 regulates EMT in human pancreatic cancer cells via a miR-200a dependent mechanism [11] and is also a regulator of let-7a in pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells, which supports the concept that these miRNAs are relevant and novel targets in several solid tumor cancers [10,11,27,30,41]. DCLK1 is a putative marker of intestinal and pancreatic stem cells and is upregulated in several solid tumors providing additional evidence of its potential key role in the tumorigenic process. In this report, we have demonstrated that in addition to regulating several tumor suppressor miRNAs and downstream oncogenic targets, DCLK1 inhibition results in upregulation of miRNAs that negatively regulate several key pluripotency and pro-angiogenic factors. These data support the notion that the DCLK1 is a central regulator of the tumor process.
1580 Repression of miR-143 and miR-145, two co-transcribed miRNAs located on human chromosome 5q, has been reported in pancreatic cancer. Accumulating data suggest that they possess tumor suppressor activity [50,51]. Reduced miR-143/145 expression is a common feature of many tumor types including colorectal carcinoma and PDAC [29,50,51]. Moreover, expression of these miRNAs inhibits proliferation and activates apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [29]. The miR-143/145 cluster, cooperate and inhibit the expression of KRAS2 and its downstream effector, RREB1 [29]. It has been recently demonstrated that systemic delivery of miR-143/145 via nanovectors blocked the growth of MiaPaCa-2 derived subcutaneous xenografts compared with vehicle or mock nanovector empty plasmid controls [29,52]. The miRNA restitution was confirmed in treated xenografts by significant upregulation of the corresponding miRNA and significant decreases in specific miRNA targets (KRAS2 and RREB1 for miR-143/145). Here, we observed downregulation of c-MYC and KRAS via let-7a in AsPC1 tumor xenografts following the knockdown of DCLK1 (Figure S1 and Figure 3D) (a similar mechanism was previously demonstrated in pancreatic cancer cells).
1581 Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is upregulated in various cancer including pancreatic [53]. Additionally, inhibition of EGF signaling leads to inhibition of cancer initiation and progression [54]. Recently, it was reported that miR-145 inhibits cell proliferation of human lung adenocarcinoma by targeting EGFR, indicating that miR-145 is a tumor suppressor miRNA [55]. Furthermore, in another published work, it was demonstrated that EGFR suppress miR-143 and miR-145 in a murine models of colon cancer [56]. These data taken together indicate that there is a negative feedback loop mechanism between EFGR and miR-143/145 similar to KRAS/RREB1 and miR-143/145. Following the knockdown of DCLK1, we observed increase expression miR-143/145 and significant downregulation of KRAS and RREB1. We expect EGF signaling will also be downregulated following the knockdown of DCLK1.
1582 VEGF and its receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 have been demonstrated to play an important role in tumor vascular growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis [34]. Angiogenic factors are upregulated in various cancers such as colorectal, breast, renal, liver, and ovarian and have been correlated with poor prognosis. Though PDAC is not a grossly vascular tumor, they exhibit endothelial cell proliferation, one of the mechanisms that increase angiogenesis [38]. Inhibition of VEGF-A, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 resulted in inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis in mouse models of PDAC [35–38]. Based on previous studies and computational analysis of the 3’ UTR of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, we observed a putative binding site for miR-200 (miR-200a, b and c) [48,49]. Following the knockdown of DCLK1, miR-200 miRNAs were upregulated and resulted in inhibition of its downstream targets (EMT-transcription and angiogenic factors). Taken together, knockdown of DCLK1 is beneficial in preventing EMT, metastasis and angiogenesis.
1583 These exciting new data illustrate the enormous potential of miRNA-based therapy. In this report, we attempt to advance this concept a bit further. Our data suggest that by down-regulating DCLK1 expression in pancreatic cancer, we are directly inducing or facilitating upregulation of several endogenous miRNAs within the tumors. The role of DCLK1 in the regulation of pluripotency in a cancer context is novel and may present an exciting new target for anti-cancer based therapy. Using this candidate approach, we contend that endogenous upregulation of tumor suppressors may have an advantage over small molecule inhibitor-based approaches or even protein or miRNA replacement therapies. For example, a single therapeutic miRNA may regulate hundreds of critical pathways that drive tumorigenesis; whereas, the introduction of a single DCLK1 targeted agent may induce multiple therapeutic miRNAs. This mechanism may be relatively safe if recently published reports suggesting that quiescent stem cell populations are dispensable for normal homeostatic processes but are likely activated during geno/cytotoxic injury and neoplasia are correct [39,57]. Additionally, a recent study has demonstrated that ablation of Dclk1+ cells in Apcmin/+ mice resulted in regression of intestinal polyps without affecting the normal intestinal homeostasis [43]. These data provide the rationale for ongoing studies that investigate the role of DCLK1 in the regulation of miRNAs in cancer.
1584 It has been demonstrated that process of dedifferentiation and EMT may result in generation of stem cell-like properties. Overexpression of pluripotency factors or stem cell maintaining factors results in dedifferentiation of fibroblasts to iPSCs. It has been recently reported that poorly differentiated breast, glioma and bladder cancer cells express a pluripotent stem cell-like signature [58]. Furthermore, induction of EMT in mammary epithelial cells generates or expresses stem cell-like phenotypes [9]. Cells isolated based on stem cell markers (CD44high and C24low) had undergone EMT and overexpressed EMT markers like ZEB2, SNAIL and TWIST and also had the ability to form mammospheres [9,27]. These studies provide the link between the role of pluripotency factors and EMT in cancers that we explore in this report. Here we propose the hypothesis that DCLK1-mediated overexpression of these pluripotency factors in cancer cells may drive them towards a poorly differentiated phenotype, which may in turn facilitate the process of EMT [27]. Nevertheless, in this study, inhibition of DCLK1 results in inhibition of pluripotency markers and induction of miR-200 (EMT inhibitor) and thereby drives the cancer cells towards a differentiated state with reduced invasive properties. The inhibition of invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells was observed in the invasion assay following the knockdown of DCLK1 (Figure 5E and F).
1585 Overexpression of NOTCH1 led to the induction of EMT phenotype by activation of mesenchymal cell markers such as ZEB1, CD44, EpCAM, and Hes-1 [59]. Moreover, alteration of the miR-200 family has been found to be associated with the NOTCH signaling pathway in pancreatic CSCs. Furthermore, it was found that overexpression of miR-200 family significantly inhibits the NOTCH pathway in pancreatic cancer cells, which suggests the NOTCH pathway may be one of the miR-200 targets [60]. In this report, consistent with our previous studies, we observed downregulation of NOTCH1 in tumors treated with NPsiDCLK1 (Figure S2).
1586 All of these studies indicate that pluripotency, angiogenesis, EMT, NOTCH1, and cancer stemness are all involved in the complex interplay of cellular signaling, which are critical features of the tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer that play an important role in cancer initiation, progression and metastasis. The studies presented clearly implicate DCLK1 in the regulation of miR-143/145, miR-200, EMT, pluripotency, angiogenesis, NOTCH1, and cancer stemness. Inhibition of multiple oncogenic pathways following the knockdown of DCLK1 was also observed in BxPC-3, human pancreatic cancer cell line (Figures S3 and S4). Finally, NPsiDCLK1 administered via intratumoral injection at a dose of 5 µM for 15 days had no overt toxicity in the mice, which demonstrates its safety in vivo. These data taken together suggest that DCLK1 plays a central regulatory role in pancreatic tumorigenesis, and the delivery of targeted siRNA based therapeutics that inhibit multiple pro-tumorigenic pathways under the control of DCLK1 may represent a simple straightforward approach to combat pancreatic cancer and perhaps other human solid tumor cancers. Finally, we contend that beyond its status as a putative marker of quiescent stem cells and/or Tuft cells, DCLK1 plays a central role in the initiation, progression and dissemination of cancer cells. This combined with its central regulatory role in stem cell-like processes, pluripotency factor regulation, EMT and angiogenesis makes it an ideal and novel target for therapy in pancreatic cancer and perhaps other solid tumors.

1683 SUMMARY
1684 MicroRNAs are well-suited to regulate tumor metastasis due to their capacity to coordinately repress numerous target genes, thereby potentially enabling their intervention at multiple steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade. We identify a microRNA exemplifying these attributes, miR-31, whose expression correlates inversely with metastasis in human breast cancer patients. Overexpression of miR-31 in otherwise-aggressive breast tumor cells suppresses metastasis. We deploy a stable microRNA sponge strategy to stably inhibit miR-31 in vivo; this allows otherwise-non-aggressive breast cancer cells to metastasize. These phenotypes do not involve confounding influences on primary tumor development and are specifically attributable to miR-31-mediated inhibition of several steps of metastasis, including local invasion, extravasation or initial survival at a distant site, and metastatic colonization. Such pleiotropy is achieved via coordinate repression of a cohort of metastasis-promoting genes, including RhoA. Indeed, RhoA re-expression partially reverses miR-31-imposed metastasis-suppression. These findings indicate that miR-31 uses multiple mechanisms to oppose metastasis.

1686 INTRODUCTION
1687 Metastases account for 90% of human cancer deaths (Gupta and Massagué, 2006), yet our understanding of the molecular circuitry that governs metastatic dissemination remains fragmentary. The invasion-metastasis cascade, which leads to these growths, is a complex, multistep process involving the escape of neoplastic cells from a primary tumor (local invasion), intravasation into the systemic circulation, survival during transit through the vasculature, extravasation into the parenchyma of distant tissues, the establishment of micrometastases, and ultimately the outgrowth of macroscopic secondary tumors (colonization) (Fidler, 2003).
1688 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute an evolutionarily conserved class of pleiotropically acting small RNAs that suppress gene expression post-transcriptionally via sequence-specific interactions with the 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of cognate mRNA targets (Bartel, 2009). In mammalian cells, miRNAs effect gene silencing via both translational inhibition and mRNA degradation; an individual miRNA is capable of regulating dozens of distinct mRNAs, and together the >650 human miRNAs are believed to modulate greater than one-third of the mRNA species encoded in the genome (Bartel, 2009).
1689 A central role for miRNAs in the establishment and progression of human tumors has begun to emerge. More than 50% of miRNA-encoding loci reside in chromosomal regions altered during tumorigenesis (Calin et al., 2004), and expression profiling reveals characteristic miRNA signatures for many tumor types – including breast neoplasias – that predict disease status and clinical outcome (Calin and Croce, 2006). In addition, miRNAs have been identified that function as classical oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (Ventura and Jacks, 2009), as well as a limited number that act at late stages of tumor progression (Ma et al., 2007; Tavazoie et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2008; Asangani et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2008; Lujambio et al., 2008).
1690 The extent to which miRNAs specifically affect metastasis remains unclear, as all the miRNAs reported to affect metastasis also exert potentially confounding influences on primary tumor development, apoptosis, and/or cell proliferation (Voorhoeve et al., 2006; Sathyan et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2007; Si et al., 2007; Tavazoie et al., 2008; Kondo et al., 2008; Lujambio et al., 2008). Moreover, a role for miRNAs in steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade subsequent to local invasion has not been described.
1691 The pleiotropic nature of gene regulation exhibited by miRNAs led us to hypothesize that certain miRNAs might be endowed with a capacity to function as crucial modulators of tumor metastasis. Here, we identify an anti-metastatic human miRNA, miR-31, that acts at multiple steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade via repression of a cohort of pro-metastatic targets.

1693 RESULTS
1694 miR-31 Expression is Specifically Attenuated in Metastatic Breast Cancer Cell Lines
1695 To identify miRNAs that might regulate breast cancer metastasis, we selected 10 cancer-associated miRNAs for further characterization due to their concordant identification among expression profiling studies of clinical breast tumors (Iorio et al., 2005; Volinia et al., 2006), global analysis of miRNA copy-number variation in human breast carcinomas (Zhang et al., 2006), and localization of miRNA loci to cancer-relevant sites of chromosomal aberration (Calin et al., 2004) (Table S1). These studies did not stratify patients based on metastasis status.
1696 Expression of the 10 candidate miRNAs was assayed in 15 human and mouse mammary cell lines, which included normal epithelial cells, tumorigenic but non-metastatic cells, and metastatic tumor cells (Table S2). The levels of a single miRNA, miR-31, were specifically attenuated in aggressive human breast cancer cells when compared to primary normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). While non-metastatic tumor cells (HMLER, MCF7-Ras, and SUM-149) exhibited four-fold reduced miR-31, expression of this miRNA in metastatic SUM-159 and MDA-MB-231 cells was diminished by >100-fold (Figure 1A).
1697 Figure 1
1698 Figure 1
1699 miR-31 Levels Correlate Inversely With Metastatic Ability in Breast Cell Lines
1700 Relative to its expression in normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) cells, miR-31 levels in sub-lines derived from a single murine mammary tumor reflected their capacities to metastasize: miR-31 was reduced by two-fold in metastatic D2.1 and D2A1 cells, but not in non-aggressive D2.OR cells (Figure 1B). miR-31 levels were also inversely proportional to metastatic ability in four mouse mammary carcinoma sub-lines derived from a single spontaneously arising tumor: while miR-31 levels in non-aggressive 67NR cells were similar to those in NMuMG, miR-31 expression was progressively diminished upon acquisition of the capacity to invade locally (168FARN), to form micrometastases (4TO7), and to yield macroscopic metastases (4T1) (Figure 1B). Thus, miR-31 levels are specifically attenuated in aggressive breast cancer cells.
1701 miR-31 expression was heterogeneous in 4T1 cell primary mammary tumors; of note, the proportion of cells expressing miR-31 was 10-fold reduced in lung metastases relative to the fraction of miR-31-positive cells in the primary tumors from which they were derived (Figure 1C). Also, five-fold fewer cells located near the invasive front of 4T1 cell mammary tumors expressed miR-31, compared to cells in the interior of these tumors (Figure 1D). These data raise the possibility that selective pressures diminish the prevalence of miR-31-expressing cells within the pool of successfully metastasizing cells during the course of metastatic progression.
1702 miR-31 Expression Suppresses Metastasis-Relevant Traits in vitro
1703 Given these inverse correlations between miR-31 levels and malignant phenotypes, we assessed the potential for anti-metastatic roles for miR-31. Thus, we stably expressed miR-31 in metastatic MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells (“231 cells”). This overexpression resulted in miR-31 levels comparable to those in HMECs (Figure S1A).
1704 Ectopic miR-31 did not affect proliferation in vitro, but did reduce invasion by 20-fold and motility by 10-fold (Figures 2A and S1B-S1C). These effects were specifically attributable to the biological activities of miR-31, as equivalent overexpression of a control miRNA, miR-145, failed to influence invasion or motility (Figure 2A and data not shown). Also, miR-31-expressing cells exhibited 60% diminished resistance to anoikis-mediated cell death (Figure 2B).
1705 Figure 2
1706 Figure 2
1707 miR-31 Expression Inhibits Metastasis
1708 These defects could not be ascribed to toxicity resulting from ectopic miR-31 (Figure S1D). The consequences of miR-31 expression were not unique to 231 cells: miR-31 reduced invasion, motility, and anoikis resistance, yet did not affect proliferation, in aggressive SUM-159 human breast cancer cells (Figure S2). Hence, miR-31 impairs in vitro surrogates of metastatic ability.
1709 miR-31 Expression Suppresses Metastasis in vivo
1710 Due to its effects on in vitro traits associated with high-grade malignancy, we asked if ectopic miR-31 could inhibit metastasis in otherwise-aggressive cells. Thus, 231 cells expressing miR-31 were injected into the orthotopic site – the mammary fat pad – of mice. Unexpectedly, miR-31 enhanced primary tumor growth by 1.5-fold and correspondingly increased cell proliferation (Figure 2C and S3A). Control 231 cell primary tumors displayed evidence of local invasion; however, miR-31-expressing tumors were well-encapsulated and non-invasive (Figures 2D and 2E). These changes were not accompanied by altered neovascularization (Figure S3B).
1711 Despite their ability to generate larger primary tumors, 231 cells expressing miR-31 were strikingly impaired in their capacity to seed lung metastases. miR-31-expressing cells formed 95% fewer lesions than did controls 62 days post-implantation (Figure 2F). Thus, miR-31 suppresses metastasis from an orthotopic site, ostensibly due, at least in part, to its ability to impede local invasion.
1712 We addressed the possibility that miR-31’s impact on these parameters was attributable to clonal variation in our 231 cells by expressing miR-31 in a single-cell-derived population isolated from the parental 231 cells (Figure S4A) (Minn et al., 2005). As before, when injected orthotopically, miR-31-expressing cells formed large, well-encapsulated primary tumors and also reduced lung metastasis by five-fold (Figures S4B-S4D). Orthotopic injection of SUM-159 cells expressing miR-31 further corroborated our earlier findings: miR-31 enhanced primary tumor growth, yet miR-31-expressing tumors were more well-confined than control tumors (Figure S5). These observations indicated that the ability of miR-31-expressing cells to form larger, less invasive primary tumors, as well as to seed fewer metastases, is a specific consequence of the biological activities of miR-31.
1713 We determined if miR-31’s impact on metastasis was also attributable to effects on later steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade, independent of its influence on local invasion. Thus, we injected miR-31-expressing 231 cells directly into the circulation of mice, thereby circumventing the initial steps of local invasion and intravasation. After one day, miR-31-expressing cells were four-fold impaired in their ability to persist in the lungs (Figure 2G). This difference was not a consequence of an inability of miR-31-expressing cells to become lodged initially in the lung microvasculature, as equal numbers of miR-31-expressing and control cells were detected in the lungs 10 minutes and two hours post-injection (Figures 2G and S6A). These observations suggested that miR-31 regulates early post-intravasation events, such as intraluminal viability, extravasation, and/or initial survival in the lung parenchyma.
1714 Three months after tail vein injection, miR-31-expressing 231 cells generated 40-fold fewer lung metastases than did controls (Figure 2G). We also observed a dramatic effect on the size of eventually formed lesions: after three months, miR-31-expressing cells generated only small micrometastases while control cells formed macroscopic metastases; this occurred despite the fact that miR-31-expressing and control cells established comparably sized micrometastases one month post-injection (Figures 2G and S6B). Such effects on lesion size implied that miR-31 affects metastatic colonization in addition to its influences on local invasion and early post-intravasation events.
1715 Inhibition of miR-31 Promotes Metastasis-Relevant Traits in vitro
1716 The preceding observations demonstrated that miR-31 expression deprives metastatic cells of attributes associated with high-grade malignancy. We next asked if miR-31 also prevents the acquisition of aggressive traits by otherwise-non-metastatic human breast cancer cells. To do so, we transiently inhibited miR-31 in non-invasive MCF7-Ras cells with either antisense oligonucleotides or miRNA sponges. The latter are expression constructs that carry miRNA recognition motifs in their 3’ UTR that bind and thus titer miRNAs (Ebert et al., 2007). Both approaches inhibited miR-31 function by >4.5-fold (Figure S7A). Suppression of miR-31 enhanced invasion by 20-fold and motility by five-fold, but cell viability was unaffected by either inhibitor (Figures 3A and S7B).
1717 Figure 3
1718 Figure 3
1719 Inhibition of miR-31 Promotes Metastasis
1720 Techniques for stable miRNA inhibition have been unavailable (Krützfeldt et al., 2006). To address this problem, we modified elements derived from the transiently expressed miRNA sponges, cloned them into a retroviral vector, and created MCF7-Ras cells that stably express the modified miRNA sponges. The miR-31 sponge reduced miR-31 function by 2.5-fold, but did not affect the activity of other known anti-metastatic miRNAs (Figures S8A and S8B). The relatively modest suppression of miR-31 conferred by stable sponge expression elicited strong responses: invasion was enhanced by 12-fold, motility by eight-fold, and anoikis resistance by 2.5-fold (Figures 3B and S8C). The miR-31 sponge failed to alter in vitro proliferation (Figure S8D).
1721 When stably expressed in immortalized HMECs or tumorigenic but non-metastatic SUM-149 human breast cancer cells, the miR-31 sponge elicited increased invasion, motility, and anoikis resistance without affecting proliferation (Figure S9 and data not shown). Collectively, these data indicated that sustained miR-31 activity is necessary to prevent the acquisition of aggressive traits by both tumor cells and untransformed breast epithelial cells.
1722 Inhibition of miR-31 Promotes Metastasis in vivo
1723 We exploited our ability to stably inhibit miRNAs in order to assess whether miR-31 activity is required to prevent metastasis in vivo. To do so, otherwise-non-metastatic MCF7-Ras cells stably expressing the miR-31 sponge were orthotopically implanted into mice. Inhibition of miR-31 failed to alter in vivo proliferation and primary tumor growth (Figures 3C and S10A). Primary tumors derived from miR-31 sponge-expressing cells were poorly encapsulated and locally invasive, while control MCF7-Ras tumors appeared well-confined and non-invasive (Figures 3D and 3E). Again, neovascularization did not differ (Figure S10B).
1724 Strikingly, miR-31 sponge-expressing MCF7-Ras cells metastasized to the lungs in significant numbers, while control tumor-bearing host lungs were largely devoid of tumor cells; cells with impaired miR-31 activity formed 10-fold more lesions than did controls (Figure 3F). Hence, continuous miR-31 function is required to prevent metastasis from an orthotopic site.
1725 We asked if loss of miR-31 activity also promoted metastasis by intervening at steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade subsequent to local invasion. Thus, we intravenously injected mice with miR-31 sponge-expressing MCF7-Ras cells. Within one day, miR-31 inhibition enhanced cell number in the lungs by six-fold; similarly, at later times after injection, miR-31 sponge-expressing cells were 10-fold more prevalent in the lungs than were controls (Figure 3G). The differing metastatic abilities of control and miR-31 sponge-expressing cells did not arise due to failure of control cells to become lodged initially in the lung vasculature, as equal numbers of cells from each cohort were present 10 minutes after injection (Figures 3G and S11).
1726 Suppression of miR-31 also affected lesion size four months after tail vein injection: whereas control cells formed only small micrometastases, miR-31 sponge-expressing cells produced macroscopic metastases (Figure 3G). Together, these data extended and reinforced our ectopic expression studies by demonstrating that miR-31 affects local invasion, early post-intravasation events, and metastatic colonization.
1727 miR-31 Directly Regulates a Cohort of Pro-Metastatic Genes
1728 miR-31’s ability to impede multiple steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade might derive from its ability to pleiotropically regulate genes involved in diverse aspects of metastatic dissemination. To identify effectors of miR-31, we used two algorithms that predict the mRNA targets of a miRNA – PicTar (Krek et al., 2005) and TargetScan (Grimson et al., 2007). Based on the representation of miR-31 sites in their 3’ UTRs, >200 mRNAs were predicted to be regulated by miR-31. Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000) revealed that these targets included a disproportionately large number of genes encoding proteins with roles in motility-related processes, such as cell adhesion, cytoskeletal remodeling, and cell polarity (data not shown).
1729 Guided by this Gene Ontology analysis, we cloned the 3’ UTRs of 16 putative miR-31 targets from these overrepresented categories, including several implicated in tumor invasion (Sahai and Marshall, 2002; McClatchey, 2003), into a luciferase construct. Reporter assays using miR-31-expressing 231 cells revealed that miR-31 repressed six of the UTRs: frizzled3 (Fzd3), integrin α5 (ITGA5), myosin phosphatase-Rho interacting protein (M-RIP), matrix metallopeptidase 16 (MMP16), radixin (RDX), and RhoA (Figure 4A). Mutation of the putative miR-31 site(s) in these six 3’ UTRs (Table S3) abrogated responsiveness to miR-31 (Figure 4B). In the case of RhoA, whose UTR contains two miR-31 sites separated by 152 nucleotides, mutation of either motif abolished miR-31-responsiveness (Figure 4B), suggesting functional interaction between the sites (Grimson et al., 2007).

1732 miR-31 Directly Regulates a Cohort of Pro-Metastatic Genes
1733 Endogenous Fzd3, ITGA5, MMP16, RDX, and RhoA protein levels were assayed in miR-31-expressing 231 cells. miR-31 repressed the levels of these proteins by 40–60% (Figure 4C). miR-31’s effects on levels of the M-RIP protein could not be evaluated due to the lack of appropriate antibodies. Also, miR-31 reduced the endogenous mRNA levels of these six targets by two-fold in SUM-159 cells, as well as Fzd3, ITGA5, MMP16, RDX, and RhoA mRNA levels in 231 cells (Figure 4D). miR-31 did not affect CXCL12 mRNA levels – a computationally predicted miR-31 target found not to be regulated by this miRNA – in either cell type (Figures 4A and 4D). These data indicated that miR-31 directly regulates endogenous Fzd3, ITGA5, M-RIP, MMP16, RDX and RhoA expression in human breast cancer cells.
1734 We determined if concomitant repression of Fzd3, ITGA5, M-RIP, MMP16, RDX, and RhoA correlated with disease progression in clinical breast cancers by examining expression profiling data from 295 primary breast tumors (Table S4) (van de Vijver et al., 2002). To do so, we constructed a miR-31 target signature based on coordinate differential expression of these six genes. Within this cohort, high expression of the miR-31 target signature was associated with metastasis, as well as poor survival, relative to signature-negative tumors; five-year survival among patients negative for the target signature was 90%, while >35% of target signature-positive patients succumbed to their disease over this interval (Figures 5A and 5B). Thus, coordinate repression of Fzd3, ITGA5, M-RIP, MMP16, RDX, and RhoA correlated with more favorable outcome in clinical breast tumors.

1737 Repression of Fzd3, ITGA5, RDX, and RhoA Underlies miR-31-Dependent Phenotypes in vitro
1738 To assess the functional contributions of these miR-31 targets to aggressive phenotypes, we first examined if their inhibition affected the invasion or motility of 231 cells. Transfection with siRNAs potently reduced target protein levels without affecting cell viability (Figures S12A and S12B). siRNAs targeting Fzd3, ITGA5, RDX, or RhoA reduced invasion and motility, while siRNAs against M-RIP or MMP16 failed to affect these traits (Figures 5C and S12C).
1739 We asked if inhibition of these effectors compromised resistance to anoikis. siRNAs against ITGA5, RDX, or RhoA sensitized 231 cells to anoikis; in contrast, siRNAs targeting Fzd3, M-RIP, or MMP16 had no effect on anoikis resistance (Figure 5D). Hence, suppression of Fzd3, ITGA5, RDX, or RhoA impaired metastasis-relevant traits in vitro.
1740 Re-Expression of Fzd3, ITGA5, RDX, and RhoA Reverses miR-31-Dependent Metastasis-Relevant Phenotypes in vitro
1741 To determine whether in vitro phenotypes associated with miR-31 expression could be reversed via restoration of Fzd3, ITGA5, M-RIP, MMP16, RDX, or RhoA levels, we transfected miR-31-expressing 231 cells with individual expression constructs rendered miRNA-insensitive by deletion of their 3’ UTRs; this was not cytotoxic (Figures S13A-S13B and data not shown). In miR-31-expressing cells, Fzd3, ITGA5, RDX, or RhoA reversed, at least partially, miR-31-imposed invasion and motility defects; in contrast, M-RIP or MMP16 had no effect on these traits (Figures 5E and S13C). Surprisingly, re-expression of RDX or RhoA completely rescued miR-31-mediated invasion and motility defects. Expression of the six targets failed to enhance the invasion or motility of control 231 cells (Figures 5E and S13C).
1742 We evaluated if re-expression of any of the six targets rescued miR-31’s effects on anoikis. ITGA5, RDX, or RhoA reversed, at least in part, anoikis susceptibility resulting from ectopic miR-31; in contrast, Fzd3, M-RIP, or MMP16 failed to affect this trait (Figure 5F). In fact, ITGA5 or RhoA completely rescued miR-31-dependent anoikis phenotypes. The six targets did not enhance anoikis resistance in control 231 cells (Figure 5F). Hence, Fzd3, ITGA5, RDX, and RhoA are functionally relevant effectors of miR-31 for conferring malignant traits in vitro.
1743 Re-Expression of RhoA Partially Reverses miR-31-Imposed Metastasis Defects in vivo
1744 RhoA afforded the most pronounced reversal of miR-31-mediated phenotypes. Thus, we stably re-expressed miRNA-resistant RhoA in 231 cells that already had been infected with either miR-31 or control vector (Figures S14A and S14B). RhoA did not affect proliferation in vitro, but did abrogate miR-31-imposed invasion, motility, and anoikis resistance defects (Figures S14C-S14F).
1745 To ascertain if restored RhoA levels reversed in vivo metastasis phenotypes ascribable to miR-31, we orthotopically injected mice with 231 cells expressing combinations of miR-31, RhoA, and control vectors. As observed previously, miR-31 enhanced primary tumor growth (Figure 6A). RhoA initially augmented primary tumor growth in the presence of ectopic miR-31, but failed to do so in control 231 cells (Figure 6A). In consonance with our earlier findings, control 231 primary tumors were locally invasive, while miR-31-expressing tumors were non-invasive (Figures 6B and 6C). In control 231 cells, ectopic RhoA failed to exacerbate the extent of local invasion; in contrast, RhoA abolished the previously encapsulated appearance of miR-31-expressing tumors and enabled invasion into surrounding normal tissue (Figures 6B and 6C).
1746 Figure 6
1747 Figure 6
1748 Re-Expression of RhoA Partially Reverses miR-31-Imposed Metastasis Defects in vivo
1749 Re-expression of RhoA restored lung metastasis in miR-31-expressing 231 cells to 75% of control cell levels, while RhoA failed to enhance metastasis in control 231 cells (Figure 6D). Thus, re-expression of RhoA partially, yet robustly, reverses metastasis-suppression imposed by miR-31. The observed magnitude of rescue is surprising, as RhoA is only one member of a larger cohort of metastasis-relevant genes repressed by miR-31.
1750 By intravenously injecting mice with 231 cells expressing miR-31 and/or RhoA, we gauged if RhoA-mediated reversal of miR-31-imposed metastasis defects was solely attributable to effects on local invasion. While expression of miR-31 and/or RhoA failed to affect the initial lodging of tumor cells in the lung vasculature, the number of cells that persisted in the lungs differed within one day of injection (Figures 6E and S15). As before, miR-31 inhibited both the number of metastases formed and their eventual size (Figure 6E). While expression of RhoA in control 231 cells failed to enhance metastasis, RhoA restored the number of lung metastases to 60% of control cell levels in miR-31-expressing cells; however, RhoA did not facilitate the formation of macroscopic metastases in cells with ectopic miR-31 (Figure 6E).
1751 Together, these data indicated that miR-31’s ability to inhibit metastasis is attributable, in significant part, to its capacity to inhibit RhoA. miR-31-mediated repression of RhoA affects both local invasion and early post-intravasation events. However, these data also implied that the full spectrum of miR-31’s effects on metastasis are elicited only via the coordinate repression of multiple targets, as suppression of RhoA alone could not explain the complete impact of miR-31 on the number of metastases formed or its effects on metastatic colonization.
1752 miR-31 Expression Correlates Inversely With Metastasis in Human Breast Tumors
1753 Because established cell lines and xenograft studies cannot fully recapitulate clinical malignancy, we extended our analyses by assaying miR-31 expression in specimens from 56 human breast cancer patients (Table S5; Median follow-up = 59 months). Relative to grade-matched estrogen receptor (ER)+ tumors, which are associated with more favorable disease outcome (Sørlie et al., 2001), basal-like tumors exhibited 40% reduced miR-31; no difference in miR-31 levels was observed between ER+ and HER2+ tumors (Figure S16).
1754 When these 56 tumors were stratified based on clinical progression, we found that miR-31 expression was diminished in primary tumors that subsequently metastasized, when compared to normal breast tissue and primary tumors that did not recur; moreover, low miR-31 levels correlated strongly with reduced distant disease-free survival relative to tumors with high miR-31 (Figures 7A and 7B). Similarly, within this cohort of tumors, high RhoA expression was associated with an increased incidence of distant metastasis (Figure S17).
1755 Figure 7
1756 Figure 7
1757 miR-31 Levels Correlate Inversely With Metastasis in Human Breast Tumors
1758 The association of low miR-31 levels with metastasis persisted independent of both tumor grade and molecular subtype (Figure S18). Such grade- and subtype-independence is quite surprising, as clinically utilized prognostic markers for breast cancer largely correlate with these parameters; furthermore, currently available markers do not identify a worse-prognosis group within the more aggressive basal-like or HER2+ subtypes (Desmedt et al., 2008). Thus, miR-31 may represent a marker for metastasis in a variety of breast cancer subtypes; however, its utility as a prognostic indicator will depend on extension of these initial observations.
1759 We next assessed the heterogeneity of miR-31 expression in human primary breast tumors, as well as distant metastases arising in the same patients. miR-31 was expressed in 65% of the cells in these primary tumors; however, miR-31 was detected in only 12–30% of cells in patient-matched distant metastases (Figure 7C). These data raise the possibility that selective pressures operating over the course of breast cancer progression diminish the representation of miR-31-expressing cells within the population of successfully metastasizing cells.
1760 Finally, we asked if expression of ITGA5, RDX, and RhoA was also heterogeneous in primary human breast tumors. RDX and RhoA were expressed in 60–75% of cells in the primary tumors examined, while ITGA5 was detected in >80% of cells (Figure 7D). Distant metastases were more homogeneous for the expression of RDX and RhoA than the primary tumors from which they were derived, as >90% of cells in the metastases expressed RDX and RhoA (Figure 7D). Similarly, >90% of cells in the metastases expressed ITGA5; however, the widespread ITGA5 expression observed in the patient-matched primary tumors complicates interpretation of its expression in distant metastases (Figure 7D).

1762 DISCUSSION
1763 miRNAs can modulate a wide variety of biological processes. In the present report, we demonstrate that a single human miRNA, miR-31, is endowed with the ability to concomitantly repress multiple pro-metastatic targets and to thereby inhibit several distinct steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade. Moreover, miR-31 levels correlate inversely with metastatic recurrence in a cohort of human breast tumors, a preliminary association that appears to persist independent of both tumor grade and subtype.
1764 Genome-wide studies have described miR-31 downregulation or deletion of the miR-31 genomic locus in human breast cancers (Calin et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2006; Yan et al., 2008). Expression profiling of clinical breast tumors revealed reduced miR-31 in luminal B (relative to luminal A), basal-like, and HER2+ tumors (Mattie et al., 2006; Blenkiron et al., 2007) – patterns of reduction that correlate with aggressive disease (Sørlie et al., 2001). In contrast, another profiling study found elevated miR-31 in human breast tumors (Volinia et al., 2006). None of these studies stratified patients by metastasis status.
1765 A limited number of miRNAs with pro- (miR-10b, -21, and -373/520c) or anti-metastatic (miR-34b/c, -126, -148a, -206, and -335) functions have been identified. However, the contributions of miR-10b, miR-21, and miR-373/520c specifically to metastasis-promotion are not easily discerned due to their mitogenic and/or anti-apoptotic roles (Voorhoeve et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2007; Si et al., 2007). Similarly, the anti-metastatic miRNAs miR-34b/c, miR-126, and miR-148a impair primary tumor growth (Lujambio et al., 2008; Tavazoie et al., 2008), while miR-206 and miR-335 inhibit proliferation or promote apoptosis (Sathyan et al., 2007; Kondo et al., 2008), again obscuring their precise roles in metastasis.
1766 In contrast, miR-31 obstructs metastasis without exerting confounding influences on primary tumor development. As such, mir-31 might aptly be categorized as a “metastasis suppressor gene” (Steeg, 2002). This unique aspect of miR-31 function, among others, raises questions regarding the still-uncharacterized role of this miRNA in normal cell and organismic physiology. Of significance, loss of miR-31 activity enhances invasiveness, motility, and anoikis resistance in untransformed human mammary epithelial cells. Hence, inactivation of miR-31 in normal epithelium may facilitate dissemination prior to transformation to a fully neoplastic state. This suggests one putative mechanism by which the invasion-metastasis cascade could be initiated very early during the course of tumor progression, a phenomenon that has recently been observed in clinical breast tumors (Hüsemann et al., 2008).
1767 Given the capacity of miR-31 to enhance primary tumor growth, an oncogenic role for this miRNA (mechanistically independent of its metastasis-suppressive functions) cannot be formally excluded. Such duality of action is not unprecedented (Massagué, 2008), and is consistent with notions that metastasis- and tumorigenesis-enabling attributes can be biologically distinct and acquired via independent selective pressures during malignant progression.
1768 Previous studies have described effects of specific miRNAs on an early stage of the invasion-metastasis cascade – local invasion. The present work demonstrates that miRNAs can also influence later steps of metastasis and that an individual miRNA can intervene at multiple distinct stages of the invasion-metastasis cascade. miR-31 regulates the local invasion of primary mammary tumors, as well as intraluminal survival, extravasation, and/or initial viability in a foreign microenvironment. miR-31 also suppresses colonization – the final and rate-limiting step of metastasis (Fidler, 2003). miR-31-imposed suppression of RhoA partially explains the effects of this miRNA on local invasion and early post-intravasation events; however, the mechanisms by which miR-31 suppresses metastatic colonization remain unresolved.
1769 The levels of several functionally relevant effectors of miR-31 correlate with disease progression in human tumors. RhoA expression, for example, is elevated in aggressive breast neoplasias (Sahai and Marshall, 2002). Similar associations have been described in human tumors for ITGA5 (Sanchez-Carbayo et al., 2006) and the RDX family (McClatchey, 2003).
1770 Re-expression of several individual miR-31 targets largely reversed miR-31-imposed defects in vitro. This may indicate that certain miR-31 effectors activate one another; however, ectopic ITGA5, RDX, or RhoA did not induce the expression of other miR-31 targets (data not shown). Alternatively, available in vitro assays might inadequately model the complexity of metastasis; hence, in vivo manifestations of modeled behaviors may require the concurrent action of multiple miR-31 effectors. Also, not all steps of metastasis can be recapitulated in vitro. Consistent with these notions, RhoA completely reversed a number of miR-31-dependent defects in vitro, yet only partially rescued miR-31-imposed metastasis phenotypes in vivo. This supports beliefs that miRNAs act via the pleiotropic regulation of multiple effectors.
1771 Our analyses rely on established human cell lines and xenograft studies, approaches that cannot fully simulate clinical carcinomas. For example, cell lines accumulate genetic changes in culture, while xenografts fail to recapitulate species-specific interactions between tumor cells and their stroma. However, the consistency of our results upon use of multiple independent cell lines (including a single-cell-derived population), the convergence of our gain- and loss-of-function findings, and our correlative studies in human breast cancer patients and murine mammary tumor cell lines argue against major confounding influences stemming from our experimental models.
1772 Collectively, the findings of the present study carry significant implications regarding our understanding of the pathogenesis of high-grade malignancies. Our data suggest that the loss of a single gene product can facilitate the completion of multiple distinct steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade; this pleiotropic action may help to explain how tumor cells can accumulate enough genetic and epigenetic aberrations over the course of a human lifespan to overcome the numerous barriers that normally operate to prevent metastasis. Moreover, because distant metastases are responsible for patient mortality in the vast majority of human carcinomas, miR-31’s ability to impede metastasis may prove to be clinically useful.

1774 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
1775 Cell Culture
1776 MDA-MB-231 and MCF7-Ras cells were obtained from the ATCC and cultured under standard conditions. HMEC and HME cells have been described (Ma et al., 2007). SCP3 cells were obtained from J. Massagué (Minn et al., 2005). SUM-149 and -159 cells were provided by S. Ethier (Ma et al., 2007). D2 cells have been described (Morris et al., 1993). 67NR, 168FARN, 4TO7, and 4T1 cells were obtained from F. Miller (Aslakson and Miller, 1992).
1777 miRNA Detection
1778 Total RNA, inclusive of the small RNA fraction, was extracted from cultured cells with a mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion). RT-PCR-based detection of mature miR-31 and 5S rRNA was achieved with a mirVana miRNA Detection Kit and gene-specific primers (Ambion).
1779 miRNA in situ Hybridization
1780 miRNA expression was assessed from paraffin sections using a protocol adapted from Silahtaroglu et al. (2007). Briefly, after a four hour pre-hybridization, a 5’ FITC-labeled miRCURY LNA probe targeting miR-31 (Exiqon) was hybridized to proteinase K-treated 10 μm sections at 55°C for 12 hours. Slides were then incubated with anti-FITC-HRP (PerkinElmer), and the resulting signal was intensified with the TSA Plus Fluorescein System (PerkinElmer).
1781 Human Breast Tumors
1782 Primary breast tumors, distant metastases, and normal breast tissue were collected and processed in compliance with a protocol approved by the Brigham and Women’s Hospital IRB. Fresh tissue was harvested from patients, OCT-embedded, snap-frozen, and preserved at −80°C. Recurrent cases were primary tumors from patients that developed distant metastases. For each recurrent case, two non-recurrent cases were selected to control for date of diagnosis, molecular subtype, lymph node status, and time of follow-up. Total RNA was isolated from 35 μm sections via TRIzol extraction and a mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit. To discern if miR-31 levels correlate with distant metastasis, primary tumors were classified as miR-31-positive or -negative. Tumors were considered miR-31-positive or -negative if the normalized expression of miR-31 resided in the top or bottom 30% of tumors in this cohort, respectively. Similarly, tumors were classified as RhoA-high or -low if their RhoA levels were in the top or bottom 30% of tumors examined.
1783 Invasion and Motility Assays
1784 For invasion assays, 1.0 x 105 cells were seeded in a Matrigel-coated chamber with 8.0 μm pores (BD Biosciences); for motility assays, 5.0 x 104 cells were plated atop uncoated membranes with 8.0 μm pores (BD Biosciences). Cells were seeded in serum-free media, and translocated toward complete growth media for 20 hours. Fugene6 (Roche) was used to transfect cells 24 hours prior to plating. 200 nM miRIDIAN miRNA Inhibitors (Dharmacon) were employed to transiently inhibit miR-31. SMARTpool siRNAs against Fzd3, ITGA5, M-RIP, MMP16, RDX, or RhoA (Dharmacon) were provided at 100 nM. Antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs were transfected 48 hours prior to seeding using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen).
1785 Anoikis Assays
1786 Anoikis resistance was evaluated by seeding 7.5 x 104 cells in ultra-low attachment plates (Corning). After 24 hours of anchorage-independent culture, cells were resuspended in 0.4% trypan blue (Sigma) and cell viability was assessed.
1787 Animal Studies
1788 All research involving animals complied with protocols approved by the MIT Committee on Animal Care. For spontaneous metastasis assays, age-matched female NOD/SCID mice (propagated on-site) were bilaterally injected into the mammary fat pad with the indicated number of tumor cells in 1:2 Matrigel (BD Biosciences) plus normal growth media. For experimental metastasis assays, age-matched female NOD/SCID mice were injected with 5.0 x 105 cells (resuspended in PBS) via the tail vein. Metastasis was quantified using a fluorescent microscope within three hours of specimen isolation.
1789 Luciferase Assays
1790 5.0 x 104 cells were co-transfected with 50 ng of the indicated pIS1 Renilla luciferase construct and 50 ng of a pIS0 firefly luciferase normalization control. Lysates were collected 24 hours post-transfection, and Renilla and firefly luciferase activities were measured with a Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega).
1791 Immunoblots
1792 Lysates were resolved by electrophoresis, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed with antibodies against β-actin (Santa Cruz), Fzd3 (Abcam), ITGA5 (Santa Cruz), MMP16 (Abcam), RDX (Cell Signaling), or RhoA (Santa Cruz).
1793 miR-31 Target Signature
1794 Expression profiling of 295 human breast tumors (van de Vijver et al., 2002) was used to categorize tumors as miR-31 target signature-positive or -negative. Tumors were considered target signature-positive or -negative if the normalized expression of multiple of the six miR-31 targets herein identified resided in the top or bottom 15% of tumors in this cohort, respectively.
1795 Immunohistochemistry
1796 Detection of Ki-67 (Pharmingen), MECA-32 (U. of Iowa), ITGA5 (Santa Cruz), RDX (Santa Cruz), or RhoA (Abcam) was performed on 5 μm paraffin sections using the indicated antibodies, Vectastain Elite ABC kits (Vector), and ImmPACT DAB Substrate (Vector).

1866 Introduction
1867 Sixteen years ago in back-to-back papers in Cell, Ambros, Ruvkun and their colleagues reported that a small RNA encoded by the lin-4 locus was capable of controlling the developmental timing of the nematode C. elegans by modulating the expression of a protein-coding gene lin-14 (Lee et al., 1993; Wightman et al., 1993). At the time few would have imagined that this discovery marked the birth of a new and far-reaching field of research. Indeed, it took several more years to appreciate that small RNAs like lin-4 (now termed microRNAs or miRNAs) were not just an interesting peculiarity of the nematode but were an abundant (and pervasive) feature of all bilateria, including Homo sapiens (reviewed in Bartel, 2004).
1868 Over the past few years, biochemical and genetic studies have begun to reveal the physiological functions of individual miRNAs. miRNAs act by modulating the expression of target genes via sequence complementarity between the so-called “seed” sequence of the miRNA and the “seed-match” present in the mRNA. Such binding inhibits the translation and reduces the stability of the target mRNA, leading to decreased expression of the target protein (reviewed in Eulalio et al., 2008)). miRNAs have been shown to control a wide array of biological processes, including differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. As the deregulation of these very same processes are hallmarks of cancer, it has been speculated for some time that mutations affecting miRNAs and/or their functional interaction with oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes might also participate to tumorigenesis. Moreover, because miRNAs can coordinately target multiple mRNAs, they could influence the activity of numerous proteins (for example, in a particular pathway) and exert more extensive effects.
1869 In this review, we summarize recent findings that now overwhelmingly support an important role for these tiny RNAs in controlling cell transformation and tumor progression as well as the critical questions that remain to be answered.
1870 Go to:
1871 A plethora of possible oncogenic mechanisms
1872 Because miRNAs act by repressing gene expression through direct base-pairing interactions with their target mRNAs, there are several possible mechanisms through which miRNAs could affect tumorigenesis. Overexpression, amplification or loss of epigenetic silencing of a gene encoding a miRNA that targets a (or multiple) tumor suppressor gene(s) could inhibit the activity of an anti-oncogenic pathway. By contrast, the physical deletion or epigenetic silencing of a miRNA that normally functions to repress expression of one or more oncogenes might lead to increased protein expression and gain of oncogenic potency. More subtle miRNA mutations could reduce or eliminate binding to key targets or even create seed sequences to target a new set of mRNAs, thereby altering the balance of critical growth regulatory proteins. Seed-match sequences of target mRNAs could also be the sites of mutation, rendering them free from the repression of a given miRNA or subject to the effects of another (Table 1).

1874 Table 1
1875 Potentially oncogenic genetic and epigenetic changes involving miRNAs or their targets. The table includes changes affecting directly the miRNA gene as well as genetic lesions in protein-coding oncogenes and tumor suppressor gene that would result in ...
1876 Although not all of these potential mechanisms have been as yet documented in human cancers, over the past half-dozen years a veritable flood of reports have linked miRNAs to tumor development in one fashion or another. These range from genomic and gene expression alterations affecting miRNA genes in human cancers to observations in genetically-engineered mouse models of the disease. Taken together, the available data provide a compelling case that alterations in miRNA-mRNA regulation can promote tumor development.
1877 As is true for protein-coding genes associated with cancer, the most convincing evidence linking miRNAs to tumorigenesis comes from genetic alterations in cancer cells. Beginning with the work of Croce and colleagues in 2002 (Calin et al., 2002), who showed that a pair of neighboring miRNAs are frequently focally deleted in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; see below), there are now several examples in which miRNA genes are either lost or amplified in tumors (Reviewed in Calin and Croce, 2006). Moreover, miRNA expression profiling studies comparing cancer tissue to normal tissue have revealed provocative patterns of miRNA expression, some of which have been linked to changes in methylation status of the miRNA genes (Reviewed in Saito and Jones, 2006). Functional studies performed in cancer cell lines or mouse models of the disease have provided further support for a direct role of a subset of these miRNAs in tumorigenesis. Similar to the miRNA field as a whole, the discovery of the physiologically relevant targets of these cancer-associated miRNAs is still lagging, but here, too, there has been recent progress with interesting candidate targets emerging.
1878 Go to:
1879 miRNAs as Oncogenes
1880 miRNAs that are amplified or over-expressed in cancer could function as oncogenes, and a number of putative oncogenic miRNAs have been proposed. An interesting case is represented by miR-155, which has been found to be upregulated in several hematopoietic malignancies and tumors of the breast, lung and pancreas (Eis et al., 2005; Kluiver et al., 2005; Metzler et al., 2004). The gene encoding the primary transcript for miR-155 had been identified well before the discovery of miRNAs, as a common proviral DNA insertion site in lymphomas induced by the avian leucosis virus (Clurman and Hayward, 1989). The absence of an obvious open reading frame remained a puzzling feature of the BIC oncogene (as it was initially named) even after it was shown that it could cooperate with Myc in lymphomagenesis and erythroleukemogenesis (Tam et al., 2002). While the observation that the BIC RNA could form extensive secondary structures (including a 145 bp stem-loop that we now know is the precursor to miR-155) suggested that the RNA itself could be the oncogenic factor (Tam, 2001; Tam et al., 1997), its mechanism of action remained unclear until the identification of miR-155. The study of genetically-engineered mice with gain- and loss-of-function alleles of miR-155 has provided valuable insights into its physiologic and oncogenic properties. Ectopic expression of miR-155 in the B cells of transgenic mice is sufficient to induce polyclonal proliferation of pre-B cells, followed by full blown B cell leukemia (Costinean et al., 2006), although the mRNA targets of miR-155 are still unknown. As for the normal functions of miR-155, the characterization of miR-155 knock-out mice indicates that this miRNA is involved in the maturation of B cells in the germinal centers (Rodriguez et al., 2007; Thai et al., 2007; Vigorito et al., 2007). Indeed, a rapid and intense induction of miR-155 is observed in germinal center B cells after antigen stimulation, and in miR-155 mutant mice, immunoglobulin isotype switching in response to T-dependent and T-independent antigens is impaired. Several targets have been proposed to be important mediators of miR-155 function in B cells, including the transcription factor Pu.1 (Vigorito et al., 2007) and the activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) (Dorsett et al., 2008; Teng et al., 2008). In an elegant set of genetic experiments in mice, two groups have shown that mutating a single recognition site for miR-155 in the 3-UTR of AID can partially phenocopy the consequences of miR-155 deletion (Dorsett et al., 2008; Teng et al., 2008).
1881 Another notable member of the family of oncogenic miRNAs is the miR-17~92 cluster. This cluster, which consists of six miRNAs that are processed from a single primary transcript, was initially linked to human cancer based on the observation that it maps to a chromosomal region that is frequently amplified in a subset of human B cell lymphomas (Ota et al., 2004). miR-17~92 is also frequently over-expressed in several other human cancers, including lung cancers (Hayashita et al., 2005), hepatocarcinomas (Connolly et al., 2008), neuroblastomas (Schulte et al., 2008), and colorectal cancers (He et al., 2005). In an important in vivo test of the oncogenic potential of miR-17~92, He et al. demonstrated that a truncated version of the cluster (lacking miR-92) could cooperate with c-Myc and greatly accelerate tumorigenesis in a mouse model of B cell lymphoma (He et al., 2005). Moreover, the miR-17~92 cluster itself is among the transcriptional targets of c-Myc (O’Donnell et al., 2005). While miR-17~92 deregulation does not appear to be sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis per se, transgenic mice over-expressing this cluster in lymphocyte progenitors cells develop a lymphoproliferative disorder affecting both B and T cells that eventually results in autoimmunity (Xiao et al., 2008). In contrast, mice carrying a homozygous deletion of the miR-17~92 locus exhibit premature death of B cells at the pro-B/pre-B stage, resulting in lymphopenia (Ventura et al., 2008).
1882 While the full spectrum of genes regulated by the six miRNAs encoded by the miR-17~92 cluster is still unknown, one candidate, the pro-apoptotic gene Bim, has been proposed to be a likely mediator of the B cell phenotype in miR-17~92-null and in miR-17~92 transgenic mice (Ventura et al., 2008; Xiao et al., 2008). Bim belongs to the family of pro-apoptotic BH3 only proteins, and has long been known to be a critical regulator of B cell survival (Bouillet et al., 1999; Bouillet et al., 2002) and a potent tumor suppressor gene in the Eμ-Myc model of B cell lymphoma (Egle et al., 2004; Hemann et al., 2005). Its 3′UTR contains multiple binding sites for miRNAs encoded by miR-17~92 and, consistent with Bim being a direct target of miR-17~92, its levels are increased in miR-17~92 –null pre-B cells and reduced in B cell from mice overexpressing miR-17~92. While Bim appears to be a functionally relevant target of miR-17~92, the expression of many other genes is likely to be controlled by this cluster, and many other putative targets have been identified (Dews et al., 2006; Fontana et al., 2008; Fontana et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2007; Petrocca et al., 2008).
1883 Go to:
1884 miRNAs as tumor suppressors
1885 Several miRNAs have been implicated as tumor suppressors based on their physical deletion or reduced expression in human cancer. Beyond these associations, functional studies of a subset of these miRNAs indicate that their over-expression can limit cancer cell growth or induce apoptosis in cell culture or upon transplantation in suitable host animals. This increasingly long list includes (but is not limited to) miR-15a~16-1 (Cimmino et al., 2005), the let-7 family (reviewed in Bussing et al., 2008), miR-34a and miR-34-b~c (reviewed in He et al., 2007b), miR-29 (Wang et al., 2008), miR-192 and miR-215 (Braun et al., 2008; Georges et al., 2008). However, in none of these cases has the definitive in vivo loss-of-function experiment been performed via gene targeting in the mouse.
1886 The miR-15a~16-1 cluster of miRNAs has recently emerged as an excellent candidate to be the long sought-after tumor suppressor gene on 13q14. This chromosomal region is deleted in the majority of CLLs as well as mantle cell lymphomas and prostate cancers (Calin et al., 2002). There is good circumstantial evidence that miR-15a~miR-16-1 is a bona fide tumor suppressor. MiR-15a~16-1 is located in the minimally deleted region in CLL (Calin et al., 2002), and a germ-line point mutation (a single base change) in pre-miR-16-1 has been observed in a few CLL patients (Calin et al., 2005). This mutation has been linked to a reduced expression of miR-16-1, possibly due to less efficient processing of the precursor RNA, but large scale studies are needed to determine whether this is indeed a cancer-predisposing mutation. An interesting observation in this regard is that in New Zealand Black mice (NZB), a mouse strain that shows a strong predisposition to the development of a B lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) reminiscent of human CLL, a very similar base change in pre-miR-16-1 has been linked to the development of LPD (Raveche et al., 2007).
1887 It appears that the tumor suppressive activity of miR-15a~16-1 is not limited to B cells. Over 50% of human prostate cancers show deletion of 13q14. Accordingly, a recent study has shown that inhibition of miR-15a and miR-16 activity leads to prostatic hyperplasia in mice and promotes survival, proliferation and invasion of primary prostate cells in vitro (Bonci et al., 2008). In the same study, the therapeutic potential of reconstituting expression of this cluster was illustrated by the significant regression of prostatic tumor xenografts upon intra-tumoral delivery of miR-15a and miR-16-1. While the identity of the critical targets of these two miRNAs is still unknown, the list of oncogenes that are directly regulated by miR-15a and miR-16-1 include BCL2, CyclinD1 and WNT3A (Bonci et al., 2008; Cimmino et al., 2005).
1888 Among the most actively studied of the putative tumor suppressive miRNAs are the members of the let-7 family (reviewed in Bussing et al., 2008)). The human genome contains a dozen of let-7 family members, organized in eight different loci (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/sequences/mirna_summary.pl?fam=MIPF0000002). The first member of the let-7 family was discovered in C. elegans, where it induces cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation of a particular cell type at the transition from larval to adult life (Reinhart et al., 2000). Consistent with a role in inhibiting tumor development in humans, reduced levels of multiple members of the let-7 family are frequently observed in lung cancers, where they correlate with poor prognosis (Takamizawa et al., 2004; Yanaihara et al., 2006). In addition, various let-7 genes are located at chromosomal sites deleted in a variety of human cancers (Calin et al., 2004). Let-7 genes can also be directly repressed by the c-Myc oncoprotein (Chang et al., 2008) and their precursor RNAs subjected to inhibition of further processing by lin-28 (Newman et al., 2008; Rybak et al., 2008; Viswanathan et al., 2008). Functionally, let-7 has been shown to repress members of the Ras family of oncogenes (Johnson et al., 2005) as well as the oncogene HMGA2 (Lee and Dutta, 2007; Mayr et al., 2007) and even c-Myc itself (Sampson et al., 2007). In the best example of an oncogenic mutation affecting a miRNA binding site, translocations involving the HMGA2 oncogene remove functional let-7 seed-match sequences, causing over-expression of the oncoprotein (Lee and Dutta, 2007; Mayr et al., 2007). Finally, over-expression of let-7 miRNAs can suppress tumor development in mouse models of breast and lung cancer (Esquela-Kerscher et al., 2008; Kumar et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2007). Mouse knock-out studies have not been reported for any let-7 family members, and, given the potential for functional overlap within this family, it may be a while before it is clear whether loss of let-7 function in the mouse can promote tumorigenesis.
1889 A series of recent reports has explored the regulation of miRNAs by tumor suppressor genes. These studies have focused on the miRNAs regulated by p53, a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently inactivated in human cancers (reviewed in He et al., 2007b). This approach has lead to the identification of the miR-34 family as being an important mediator of p53 activity (Bommer et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2007; Corney et al., 2007; He et al., 2007a; Raver-Shapira et al., 2007; Tarasov et al., 2007; Wei et al., 2006). This family consists of three highly related miRNAs expressed from two separate loci: miR-34a from chromosome 1p36 and miR-34b/miR-34c as a cluster from 11q23. The transcription of both loci appears to be directly regulated by p53 via binding to conserved sites in the respective promoters (Chang et al., 2007; Corney et al., 2007; He et al., 2007a; Raver-Shapira et al., 2007; Tarasov et al., 2007; Wei et al., 2006). Similar to p53 itself, the expression of miR-34 can induce cell cycle arrest (Bommer et al., 2007; Cole et al., 2008; Corney et al., 2007; Tarasov et al., 2007; Tazawa et al., 2007) or apoptosis (Chang et al., 2007; Cole et al., 2008; He et al., 2007a; Raver-Shapira et al., 2007; Tarasov et al., 2007; Welch et al., 2007). Reduced expression of miR-34b/miR-34c has been reported in breast and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (Bommer et al., 2007; Calin et al., 2004). Furthermore, miR-34a is located on 1p36, a region of frequent hemizygous deletion in human neuroblastomas and a variety of other cancers (Versteeg et al., 1995). Interestingly, this region includes another candidate tumor suppressor gene, CDH5, that acts by inducing p53 expression via p19Arf (Bagchi et al., 2007). Thus, a deletion of 1p36 can in principle impair the p53 pathway simultaneously upstream and downstream of p53.

1891 miRNAs as modulators of tumor progression and metastasis
1892 In addition to their role in promoting the development of primary tumors, miRNAs have also been implicated in affecting the tumor progression process, including the lethal, metastatic phase of the disease. Several cell biological processes, including those controlling adhesion, migration and invasion, are involved in allowing primary tumor cells to leave their original location and move to another site in the body. Not surprisingly, miRNAs help to regulate these processes as well and, as such, alterations in miRNA function can influence metastatic potential (reviewed in Ma and Weinberg, 2008).
1893 Among several putative pro-metastatic miRNAs, miR-10b and miR-373 are of particular interest. miR-10b is a direct transcriptional target of Twist1 (Ma et al., 2007), a known inducer of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastatic progression (Yang et al., 2004). Ectopic expression of miR-10b in non-metastatic breast cancer cell lines promotes cellular invasiveness and the metastatic spread of transplanted tumors, at least in part as a consequence of the direct repression of the homeobox protein HOXD10 (Ma et al., 2007). miR-373 was identified in a functional screen for miRNAs that could promote cell migration in vitro (Huang et al., 2008) and its pro-metastatic potential has been validated in tumor transplantation experiments (Huang et al., 2008) using breast cancer cells. Of note, miR-373 had been previously identified as a potential oncogene (together with miR-372) in testicular germ-cell tumors (Voorhoeve et al., 2006), although it has been proposed that the prometastatic and the oncogenic properties of this miRNA are due to the regulation of different genes (CD44 and LATS2, respectively).
1894 Studies of breast cancers have also revealed a series of miRNAs that are both under-expressed in advanced cancers and capable of inhibiting cell migration and metastatic spread. Members of the miR-200 family of miRNAs target the ZEB transcription factors, known inducers of the EMT, and, thus, reduce cellular migration and invasiveness (Burk et al., 2008; Gregory et al., 2008; Korpal et al., 2008; Park et al., 2008). Based on their differential expression in non-metastatic versus metastatic breast cancer cell lines, miR-126, miR-206 and miR-335 were also proposed to be inhibitors of tumor progression (Tavazoie et al., 2008). Indeed, over-expression of these miRNAs can inhibit metastasis in a cell transplantation model and reduced expression of miR-126 and miR-335 correlates with poor metastasis-free survival of breast cancer patients (Tavazoie et al., 2008).
1895 Go to:
1896 Global deregulation of miRNAs in cancer
1897 In this review, we have focused on the role of specific miRNAs in tumorigenesis, an already extensive and rapidly expanding list. However, recent work has also revealed intriguing changes in the global state of miRNA expression in cancer. Specifically, miRNA expression profiling experiments have demonstrated that most (although not all) miRNAs are under-expressed in tumor tissue compared to normal (Lu et al., 2005). While it is possible that this phenomenon reflects the less differentiated state of the tumor cells and/or their higher proliferation rate, one alternative explanation is that reduced miRNA levels are selected for during tumorigenesis because this itself provide some proliferative or survival advantage. These two possibilities are not necessarily mutually exclusive and indeed there is experimental evidence for both. For example, a significant increase in miRNA levels is observed upon induction of differentiation of the cancer cell line HL60 (Lu et al., 2005), consistent with the function of miRNAs to reinforce transcriptional programs and help maintain the differentiated state. On the other hand, working with experimental models of lung cancer, Kumar and colleagues have shown that genetic or RNAi-based inhibition of miRNA biogenesis can promote tumor formation and progression (Kumar et al., 2007). Finally, a recent study has demonstrated a widespread transcriptional silencing of miRNAs by c-Myc (Chang et al., 2008), suggesting that this might contribute to its potent oncogenic activity.
1898 Independent of the functional consequences of miRNA expression patterns in cancer, miRNA profiles have value as diagnostic and prognostic markers of the disease. For example, it is sometimes impossible to determine the tissue of origin of a metastasis in patients with unknown primary tumors. Because many miRNAs display exquisite tissue specificity, miRNA profiling of these lesions might prove useful. Indeed, Lu and colleagues have shown that microRNAs profiling is more efficient at classifying poorly differentiated cancers than mRNA profiling (Lu et al., 2005), and Rosenfeld et al. have demonstrated an accuracy of ~90% in identifying the tissue of origin of primary and metastatic cancers using a classifier based on 48 miRNAs (Rosenfeld et al., 2008). miRNA profiling of human cancer might also help the oncologist identify the best treatment strategy by providing prognostic information (reviewed in Barbarotto et al., 2008)). Indeed, in the two most common forms of non-small cell lung cancers (adenocarcinomas and squamous cells carcinomas), high expression of miR-155 and low expression of let-7 correlate with poor prognosis (Takamizawa et al., 2004; Yanaihara et al., 2006). Similarly, in colon cancers, high miR-21 levels is associated with poor survival (Schetter et al., 2008), while in chronic lymphocytic leukemias a miRNA “signature” composed of 13 miRNAs is associated with disease progression (Calin et al., 2005). The results of these and other analogous reports are promising, but it is important to note that larger scale studies will be required to validate the usefulness of miRNA profiling in a clinical setting.

1900 A view to the future
1901 It is certainly too early to predict the full extent of the functions of miRNAs in cancer. A clearer picture will likely emerge as the efforts to re-sequence the cancer genome reveal the true frequency of mutations in miRNAs and in their target sequences in protein-coding genes (although the latter will require specific analysis of the 3′ UTR regions). At the same time, more sophisticated in vivo models will likely help determine the oncogenic and tumor suppressive potential of individual miRNAs and miRNA families. Also, improved experimental and computational methods to identify miRNA targets will provide a more comprehensive understanding of their mechanism of action and of the pathways that they modulate. It is difficult to overestimate the potential impact of these findings. As increasingly effective pharmacological means to modulate miRNA activities are currently being developed (Elmen et al., 2008a; Elmen et al., 2008b; Krutzfeldt et al., 2005), identifying miRNAs that are essential for tumor maintenance or for metastasis might provide exciting new therapeutic opportunities. What begun sixteen years ago as a peculiar discovery in the simple worm has already gone a long way to change the way we think of gene regulation. It might change the way we understand and treat cancers as well.

2002 Summary
2003 Endogenous small RNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by mechanisms conserved across metazoans. While the number of verified human miRNAs is still expanding, only few have been functionally annotated. To perform genetic screens for novel functions of miRNAs, we developed a library of vectors expressing the majority of cloned human miRNAs and created corresponding DNA barcode arrays. In a screen for miRNAs that cooperate with oncogenes in cellular transformation, we identified miR-372 and miR-373, each permitting proliferation and tumorigenesis of primary human cells that harbor both oncogenic RAS and active wild-type p53. These miRNAs neutralize p53-mediated CDK inhibition, possibly through direct inhibition of the expression of the tumor-suppressor LATS2. We provide evidence that these miRNAs are potential novel oncogenes participating in the development of human testicular germ cell tumors by numbing the p53 pathway, thus allowing tumorigenic growth in the presence of wild-type p53.
2004 Introduction
2005 Since their discovery, the functions of only a handful of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been determined (recently reviewed in Zamore and Haley, 2005). Relevant to carcinogenesis, it was found that let-7 inhibits RAS expression and in lung tumors negatively correlates with RAS levels (Johnson et al., 2005). Furthermore, the oncogenic potential of the miR-17-92 cluster was demonstrated (He et al., 2005 and O'Donnell et al., 2005). This cluster is amplified in lymphomas (Ota et al., 2004), and its introduction accelerates tumorigenicity by an as yet undefined process. These findings demonstrate the powerful ability of small RNAs to alter cellular pathways and programs. However, the small number of miRNAs with a known function stresses the need for a systematic screening approach to identify more miRNA functions.
2006 The difficulties in deciphering the mechanism of action of miRNAs with a known function and deducing their activity from their sequence are largely due to the complex relationship with their target genes. In general, target genes containing sequences that are completely complementary to the miRNA will be degraded by an RNA-interference mechanism, whereas targets with partial complementary sequences at their 3′UTR will be subjected to translation inhibition and to a lesser extent also to mRNA degradation (Doench and Sharp, 2004, Bagga et al., 2005, Lim et al., 2005 and Pillai et al., 2005). In mammals, a near-perfect complementarity between miRNAs and protein coding genes almost never exists, making it difficult to directly pinpoint relevant downstream targets of a miRNA. Several algorithms were developed that predict miRNA targets, most notably TargetScanS, PicTar, and miRanda (John et al., 2004, Lewis et al., 2005 and Robins et al., 2005). These programs predict dozens to hundreds of target genes per miRNA, making it difficult to directly infer the cellular pathways affected by a given miRNA. Furthermore, the biological effect of the downregulation depends greatly on the cellular context, which exemplifies the need to deduce miRNA functions by in vivo genetic screens in well-defined model systems.
2007 The cancerous process can be modeled by in vitro neoplastic transformation assays in primary human cells (Hahn et al., 1999). Using this system, sets of genetic elements required for transformation were identified. For example, the joint expression of the telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit (hTERT), oncogenic H-RASV12, and SV40-small t antigen combined with the suppression of p53 and p16INK4A were sufficient to render primary human fibroblasts tumorigenic (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003). Recently, these neoplastic transformation assays were used to uncover novel human tumor suppressor genes (Kolfschoten et al., 2005 and Westbrook et al., 2005).
2008 Moreover, oncogenes such as H-RASV12 provoke a stress response in primary cells that results in an irreversible growth arrest, termed premature senescence (Serrano et al., 1997). The senescent phenotype was recently shown to play a role in the protection from tumor development in vivo (Braig et al., 2005, Chen et al., 2005, Collado et al., 2005 and Michaloglou et al., 2005). The elimination of this protective mechanism by, for example, the suppression of the p53 and p16INK4A pathways permits continued proliferation of the modified primary cells in the presence of the oncogenic event, consequently leading to tumorigenicity (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003).
2009 Here, we use this model system to perform a functional genetic screen to identify miRNAs that act as oncogenes in tumorigenesis. We characterize two miRNAs whose expression can substitute for the loss of wild-type (wt) p53 that is needed to overcome oncogene-mediated arrest and implicate their involvement in the formation of testicular germ cell tumors.
2010 Results
2011 miR-Vec: A Vector-Based miRNA Expression System
2012 To identify novel functions of miRNAs, we constructed a retroviral vector for miRNA expression (miR-Vec) following a previously described approach (Chen et al., 2004). We inserted ∼500 bp fragments spanning a given miRNA-genomic region in a modified pMSCV-Blasticidin vector such that they are placed under the control of a CMV promoter (Figure 1A). To examine miRNA expression from the miR-Vec system, a miR-24 minigene-containing virus was transduced into human cells. Expression was determined using an RNase protection assay (RPA) with a probe designed to identify both precursor and mature miR-24 (Figure 1B). Figure 1C shows that cells transduced with miR-Vec-24 clearly express high levels of mature miR-24, whereas little expression was detected in control-transduced cells. Furthermore, we confirmed the consistency of miRNA expression driven by miR-Vec by cloning eight miR-Vec plasmids expressing randomly chosen miRNAs. With one exception, all constructs yielded high expression levels of mature miRNAs (Figure S1). Notably, very little pre-miRNA accumulation was detected in all cases, indicating the efficient processing of the ectopically expressed miRNAs in the cells.

2019 (D and E) BJ/ET-p53kd cells were transduced with miR-Vec-311, and BJ/ET cells were transduced with a mix of 197 other miR-Vecs. Both populations were drug selected, mixed in a ratio of 1:400, and left to grow for 2 weeks. A barcode experiment was done comparing cells right after mixing (t0) and after 2 weeks in culture (t2). The log2 of the ratio of the signals between t2 and t0 was plotted against the average signal to visualize outliers. The signal derived from the spot corresponding to Mir-311 is indicated in pink.

2021 Next, we examined the functionality of the miR-Vec system to suppress gene expression by using both GFP, tagged with a sequence complementary to miR-19, and luciferase containing either the wt 3′UTR of G6PD, a predicted miR-1 target, or control with two mutated miR-1 binding sequences (Lewis et al., 2003). Using fluorescence microscopy and luciferase assays, we observed potent and specific miRNA activity expressed from each miR-Vec (Figure S2). These results demonstrate the general applicability of miR-Vec to drive functional miRNA expression.
2022 miR-Lib and miR-Array
2023 We subsequently created a human miRNA expression library (miR-Lib) by cloning almost all annotated human miRNAs into our vector (Rfam release 6) (Figure S3). Additionally, we made a corresponding microarray (miR-Array) containing all miR-Lib inserts, which allows the detection of miRNA effects on proliferation.
2024 To test the sensitivity of screens with miR-Lib and miR-Array, we transduced modified primary BJ fibroblasts expressing ecotropic receptor and immortalized with hTERT (BJ/ET) with a mixture of 197 different miR-Vecs and mixed them in a ratio of 400:1 with BJ/ET cells containing both miR-Vec-311 and a knockdown construct for p53 (p53kd) (Figure 1D). Previously, we have shown that in a period of 2 weeks BJ/ET-p53kd cells increase 4- to 5-fold in number compared with BJ/ET cells (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003). In accordance, we observed an approximately 4-fold increase in miR-311 signal, indicating that our procedure is sensitive enough to detect mild growth differences (Figure 1E).
2025 Expression of miR-372 and miR-373 Protects from Oncogenic Stress
2026 In response to mitogenic signals from oncogenes such as RASV12, primary human cells undergo a growth arrest (Figure 2A) (Serrano et al., 1997). In contrast, primary cells lacking functional p53 efficiently overcome this arrest. This escape from oncogene-induced senescence is a prerequisite for full transformation into tumor cells. To identify miRNAs that can interfere with this process and thus might contribute to the development of tumor cells, we transduced BJ/ET fibroblasts with miR-Lib and subsequently transduced them with either RASV12 or a control vector (Figure 2B). After 2 or 3 weeks in culture, senescence-induced differences in abundance of all miR-Vecs were determined with the miR-Array. Figures 2C and S3 show that in three independent experiments the relative abundance of three miR-Vecs increased reproducibly in the RASV12-expressing population. These hits corresponded to three constructs derived from one genomic region expressing miRNAs 371, 372, 373, and 373∗ (Figure 2D). Due to the close proximity of miR-371 and miR-372 in the genome (within 0.5 kilobase), two largely overlapping constructs encoded both miRNA-371 and 372 (miR-Vec-371&2). The third construct did not overlap with miR-Vec-371&2 and encoded miRNA-373 and 373∗. Interestingly, the mature miR-373 is a homolog of miR-372, and neither shares obvious homology with either miRNA-371 or miR-373∗ (Figure 2D). This suggests that miR-372 and miR-373 caused the observed selective growth advantage.

2039 Next, we verified miRNA function in a cell-growth assay. First, we verified the expression of both miR-371 and 372 by miR-Vec-371&2 and miR-373 by miR-Vec-373 (Figure 2E). We then transduced BJ/ET cells with miR-Vec-371&2, miR-Vec-373, or the controls p53kd and vector control and then with RASV12. As expected, control cells ceased proliferating in response to RASV12, whereas p53kd cells continued to proliferate (Figure 2F). The expression of either miR-371&2 or miR-373 allowed cells to continue proliferating in the presence of oncogenic stress, validating the effect observed with the miR-Array.
2040 Oncogene-induced senescence is characterized by the appearance of cells with a flat morphology that express senescence associated (SA)-β-Galactosidase. Indeed, control RASV12-arrested cells showed relatively high abundance of flat cells expressing SA-β-Galactosidase (Figures 2G and 2H). Consistent with the cell growth assay, very few cells showed senescent morphology when transduced with either miR-Vec-371&2, miR-Vec-373, or control p53kd. Altogether, these data show that transduction with either miR-Vec-371&2 or miR-Vec-373 prevents RASV12-induced growth arrest in primary human cells.
2041 The independent identification of constructs encoding two very similar miRNAs (miR-372 and miR-373) suggests that they (but not miR-371 or miR-373∗) are required to cause this phenotype. To test this, we mutated the sequences of miR-372 and miR-373. As demonstrated by RPA, miR-Vec-372mut and miR-Vec-373mut indeed failed to express miR-372 and miR-373, respectively (Figure 3A). Note that miR-Vec-372mut still expressed miR-371 to a similar extent as the original miR-Vec-371&2. We then tested these constructs in a YFP-competition assay to detect possible growth advantages conferred by the miRNAs on BJ cells in the absence or presence of RASV12 (Figure 3B). For this purpose we used a miR-Vec vector that expresses YFP instead of a blasticidin resistance marker and compared the growth rates of YFP-tagged and untagged cells within one population. Increase in time of the YFP-positive cells within the population indicates a growth advantage conferred by the additional genetic unit encoded by the YFP vector. We also generated BJ/ET cells expressing the RASV12-ERTAM chimera gene, which is only active when tamoxifen is added (De Vita et al., 2005), and tranduced them with either YFP-tagged wt or mutant miR-Vec-371&2 and miR-Vec-373 constructs as well as p53kd, p14ARFkd, or control vectors. Figure 3B shows that even without activating RASV12 (no tamoxifen added), both miR-Vec-371&2 and miR-Vec-373 conferred a growth advantage to cells, although to a lesser extent than observed with p53kd or p14ARFkd. Once RASV12 was activated, the growth advantage of cells with miR-Vec-371&2 and 373 increased dramatically, indicating that these constructs allowed growth of cells in the presence of oncogenes while the rest of the population ceased to proliferate. In accordance with previously published data (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003), reducing p53, but not p14ARF expression, was sufficient to overcome the oncogenic stress. Consistent with our assumption that miR-372&3 are the active miRNAs, mutating their mature sequence abrogated their growth advantage. This shows that miR-372&3, but not miR-371 or miR-373∗, caused stimulation of proliferation and resistance to oncogenic stress.

2050 Expression of miR-372 and miR-373 Transforms Primary Human Cells
2051 Suppression of cellular senescence is essential for tumorigenesis. We therefore examined whether the ectopic expression of miR-372/3 is sufficient to replace loss of p53 in transformation of cells. A hallmark of cellular transformation is the ability of tumor cells to grow anchorage independently in semisolid medium and as tumors in model mice (Hahn et al., 1999 and Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000). Indeed, in a soft agar assay, modified primary human BJ/ET cells expressing hTERT, SV40-small t, RASV12, and shRNA-knockdowns for p53 and p16INK4A showed potent ability to grow in an anchorage-independent manner (Figures 3C and 3D). To mimic the expression of the complete miR-371-373 gene cluster, we made a miR-Vec expressing all miRNAs from one cluster (miR-Vec-cluster; see Figure 3A for expression). Similar to the knockdown of p53, the ability to grow in soft agar was also observed for cells containing miR-Vec-cluster, miR-Vec-371&2, or miR-Vec-373 but not miR-Vec-372mut or miR-Vec-373mut (Figures 3C and 3D). Moreover, the cells containing the miR-371-373 cluster grew efficiently as tumors in athymic nude mice (Figure 3E). These results demonstrate that miR-372&3 collaborate with RAS in transformation in a manner that resembles p53 inactivation.
2052 Importantly, our results so far indicate that the expression of miR-372&3 did not reduce the activity of RASV12, as these cells were still growing faster than normal cells and were tumorigenic, for which RAS activity is indispensable (Hahn et al., 1999 and Kolfschoten et al., 2005). Therefore, the miRNA-mediated circumvention of the activation of p53 can in principle be obtained at a level upstream of p53, on p53 itself, or downstream. To shed more light on this aspect, we examined the effect of miR-372&3 expression on p53 activation in response to oncogenic stimulation. We used for this experiment BJ/ET cells containing p14ARFkd because, following RASV12 treatment, in those cells p53 is still activated but more clearly stabilized than in parental BJ/ET cells (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003), resulting in a sensitized system for slight alterations in p53 in response to RASV12. Figure 4A shows that following RASV12 stimulation, p53 was stabilized and activated, and its target gene, p21cip1, was induced in all cases, indicating an intact p53 pathway in these cells. Therefore, it is unlikely that the miRNAs act on a factor upstream of p53 or on p53 itself to suppress the cellular response to oncogenic RAS.

2055 miR-372 and miR-373 Sustain CDK2 Activity in TGCT
2056 (A) BJ/ET-p14ARFkd-RASV12ERTAM cells containing the indicated miR-Vecs were cultured for a week in the presence or absence of tamoxifen (TAM), harvested, and subjected to immunoblot analyses to detect p21cip1, p53, and RASV12ER.
2057 (B) The same polyclonal populations as in (A) were harvested, and CDK2 kinase activity was measured using an IP-kinase protocol with Histone H1 as a substrate. Equal pulldown of CDK2 was checked by immunoblot of the same samples (lower panel).

2063 Figure options
2064 Increased levels of p21cip1 inhibit CDK activity, causing cells to arrest in G1 phase (el-Deiry et al., 1993), whereas suppression of p21cip1 allows cells to grow in the presence of RASV12 (Figure S4A). To test whether p21cip1 was still functional in the miRNA-transduced cells, we examined CDK2 activity using an IP-Kinase assay (Figure 4B). In both miR-372&3-expressing cells, CDK2 remained active following RASV12 induction, whereas it was inhibited in the control cells (Figure 4B). In contrast, miR-372&3-transduced cells were still sensitive to inhibition of CDK activity by roscovitin (Figure S4B). This indicates that the presence of miR-372/3 acts as a molecular switch to make CDK2 resistant to increased levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p21cip1.
2065 Both p53 and p21cip1 play a major role in the DNA damage response to ionizing radiation (IR) (Weinert, 1998). Since cells expressing miR-372&3 proliferate in the presence of increased p21cip1 levels, we examined their response to damaged DNA. In the presence of both miRNAs, and irrespective of RASV12 expression, IR induced a cell cycle arrest that was indistinguishable from control cells, whereas the suppression of p53 expression allowed, as expected, continuous DNA replication (Figure 4C and data not shown). These results indicate that although miR-372&3 confer complete protection to oncogene-induced senescence in a manner similar to p53 inactivation, the cellular response to DNA damage remains intact.
2066 Potential Role of miR-372 and miR-373 in Human Cancer
2067 Based on the above results, we hypothesized that miRNA-372&3 may participate in tumorigenesis of some tumors that retain wt p53 and are sensitive to DNA-damaging treatments. One such tumor type is the testicular germ cell tumor of adolescents and adults (TGCT), known for the presence of wt p53 in the majority of cases and known to be generally sensitive to chemotherapies as well as irradiation (Kersemaekers et al., 2002, Masters and Koberle, 2003 and Mayer et al., 2003). In addition, these tumors harbour an embryonic stem (ES) cell signature (Almstrup et al., 2004), which correlates with the reported ES-cell expression pattern of the miR-371-3 cluster (Suh et al., 2004). We therefore examined a number of cell lines originating from TGCTs for the expression of the miR-371-3 cluster. Four out of seven cell lines expressed this cluster (Figures 4D and S5). This result is significant as no clear expression of the miR-371-3 cluster was detected in any of the somatic cell lines we tested (originating from breast, colon, lung and brain tumors) (Figure S6).
2068 TGCTs are divided into seminomas, non-seminomas, and spermatocytic-seminoma, according to their origin, clinical behavior, and chromosomal constitution (Oosterhuis and Looijenga, 2005). The nonseminomas can be composed of embryonal carcinoma (EC, the stem cell component), teratocarcinoma (TC, somatic differentiation), and yolk sac tumor and choriocarcinoma (YS and CH, extra-embryonal tissues). All the cell lines we tested were derived from nonseminomatous tumors, as there are no other type of TGCT cell lines available so far. To substantiate our results and extend them to other TGCT types, we examined a panel of primary seminomas, nonseminomas, and spermatocytic seminomas for the expression of miR-372. Figures 4D and S7 show that most seminomas (28/32) had a clear miR-372 expression, that about two thirds (14/21) of the nonseminomas expressed miR-372, and that expression was observed in neither RNA from the spermatocytic-seminoma tumors (data not shown) nor from the normal testis tissue panel. Noteworthy is the fact that endogenous expression of miR-372 reached levels that are comparable to those driven by miR-Vec-372 (Figure 4D), indicating the biological relevance of our system in primary human fibroblast cells. Within the nonseminoma samples, both pure and mixed histologies were present (Figure S7). The RPA analysis showed that high expression of miR-372 correlated with a larger EC component. To further investigate this connection, we performed in situ miRNA hybridizations on tissue sections of 10 representative TGCTs and found in all cases 372&3 to be strictly localized to the EC component, as judged by morphology and immunohistochemistry with CD30 and Oct3/4 (Figure 4E and data not shown). Both seminomas and the EC component of nonseminomas share features with ES cells. To exclude that the detection of miR-371-3 merely reflects its expression pattern in ES cells, we tested by RPA miR-302a-d, another ES cells-specific miRNA cluster (Suh et al., 2004). In many of the miR-371-3 expressing seminomas and nonseminomas, miR-302a-d was undetectable (Figures S7 and S8), suggesting that miR-371-3 expression is a selective event during tumorigenesis.
2069 Interestingly, we noted a correlation between cluster expression and p53 status in the TGCT cell lines (Figure 4F). Whereas all three cluster-expressing cell lines contained high wt-p53 levels, NTera2 has low wild-type p53 levels, and NCCIT lost one p53 allele while the second allele is mutated (Burger et al., 1998). To strengthen the p53 connection seen in the TGCT cell lines, we examined p53 mutations in exons five to eight in the primary tumors, where the majority of mutations are found. In the nonseminoma panel, no mutations were detected. In contrast, two out of four miRNA 372-negative seminomas had an inactivating mutation in the p53 gene (SE20 in exon 8 and SE28 in exon 5; Figures 4F and S7), a rare phenomenon in TGCT (Kersemaekers et al., 2002). In contrast, none of the 13 miRNA 372&373-expressing seminomas that we examined contained mutations in p53. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the expression of miR-372/3 suppresses the p53 pathway to an extent sufficient to allow oncogenic mutations to accumulate in TGCTs.
2070 We then decided to test directly the correlation between the p53 pathway and miR-372/3 expression in TGCTs. It was technically not possible to sufficiently and persistently inhibit the expression of both miR-372 and miR-373 by methylated miRNA-oligos or knockdown vectors against the loop of the precursors (as judged by miR-372 and miR-373 luciferase reporter targets; data not shown). As an alternative approach, we used NCCIT, an embryonal carcinoma-derived cell line containing only a mutated, nonfunctional p53 that expresses very low amounts of the miR-371-3 cluster (Figure 4D) (Burger et al., 1998). We activated the p53 pathway by transfecting NCCIT cells with a p21-RFP construct that inhibits Cyclin E/CDK2 activity and examined the effects of miR372/3 by cotransfecting miR-Vec-371-3 (cluster). As expected, overexpression of p21-RFP caused accumulation of cells in G1, whereas cotransfection of Cyclin E/CDK2 allowed cells to continue proliferating in the presence of p21-RFP (Figure 4G). Significantly, cells cotransfected with the miR-Vec-cluster showed a phenotype similar to that observed with Cyclin E/CDK2. This result demonstrates the ability of miR-372 and miR-373 to overcome a p21-mediated cell cycle arrest in TGCTs and substantiates the correlation between these miRNAs, CDK and the p53 pathway.
2071 miR-372 and miRNA-373 Regulate LATS2 Expression
2072 Our results thus far indicate that miR-371-3 cluster suppresses an inhibitor of CDK activity and that this function is important for the development of TGCTs. To start to identify relevant targets of miR-372&3, we took advantage of the fact that miRNAs may cause limited destruction of their target mRNAs apart from inhibiting their translation (Lim et al., 2005). We performed an mRNA-expression array analysis comparing RASV12-expressing BJ/ET cells either containing p53kd or expressing the miR-371-3 cluster (Figures 5A and S9). We chose this setup as both cell types proliferate in the presence of oncogenic stress, thus canceling out the profound effects of cells going into senescence. We first looked in the p53kd cells and found p53 itself and many of its transcriptional targets to be downregulated compared to the cluster-expressing cells (Figure 5A). This independently confirms our previous results (Figure 4A) indicating that miR-372&373 do not directly inhibit p53 activity. From the list of genes whose expression was 2- or more fold lower in the cluster-expressing cells, we used target prediction programs to find possible direct targets of miR-372&3. We identified three miR-372/3 predicted targets: FYCO1 (FYVE and coiled coil containing protein 1), Suv39-H1, and LATS2 (Figure 5A). Interestingly, while nothing is known on the function of the FYCO1 protein, both Suv39-H1 and LATS2 have been connected in the past to RASV12-mediated transformation. It was recently shown that lymphocytes from mice nullizygous for Suv39-H1 are resistant to oncogene-induced senescence (Braig et al., 2005). However, the mechanism underlying this effect and its conservation to other tissues and to man are not known. Most promising seemed the LArge Tumor Suppressor homolog 2 (LATS2), a serine-threonine kinase whose deletion in flies accelerates cellular proliferation and tumorigenic development (Justice et al., 1995 and Xu et al., 1995). In mice, a similar activity was seen in LATS2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (McPherson et al., 2004), whereas its overexpression was shown to inhibit cyclin E/CDK2 activity and RASV12-mediated transformation (Li et al., 2003). Additionally, loss of LATS2 stimulated reduplication, an activity comparable to that observed when Cyclin E is overexpressed in the absence of p53 (Fukasawa et al., 1996, Tarapore and Fukasawa, 2002 and Toji et al., 2004). Finally, in human breast cancer, hypermethylation of the LATS2 promoter was associated with an aggressive phenotype of the tumors (Takahashi et al., 2005). These observations suggest that the suppression of LATS2 explains at least in part the sustained activity of CDK in the presence of high p21cip1 levels in miR-372/3-expressing cells.

2075 Inhibition of LATS2 Expression by miR-372 and miR-373
2076 (A) RNA was extracted from BJ/ET cells expressing RASV12 and containing either a p53kd construct or miR-Vec-371-3 (cluster) and compared using oligo-expression arrays (Figure S9). Listed are genes whose expression was downregulated in the p53kd cells and are known transcriptional targets of p53 as well as genes whose expression was suppressed in the cluster-expressing cells and are predicted TargetScanS targets of miRNA-372&3. LATS2∗: The reduction was verified by Q-RT-PCR (Figure S10).
2077 (B and C) BJ/ET cells containing the indicated constructs were analyzed by immunoblot analysis or by Q-RT-PCR. Band intensity was calculated by densitometry.
2078 (D) The 3′-UTRs of LATS2 in human (Hs), mouse (Mm), and zebrafish (Dr) are shown, and the predicted miR-372&3 target sequences are marked.
2079 (E) The indicated vectors were transfected in miR-372&3-positive (Tera1) and negative (MCF-7) cell lines. The relative firefly luciferase levels (divided to Renilla control and compared to pGL3) are shown. SD are from three independent experiments.
2080 (F) Cumulative growth advantage assay was performed as described in Figure 3B in RASV12-expressing cells transduced with the indicated vectors. For comparison, data from Figure 3B are included (dashed lines). An accompanying immunoblot shows that only LATS2kd#2 is functional.

2082 Figure options
2083 To investigate the possibility that miR-372 and miR-373 suppress the expression of LATS2, we performed immunoblot analysis of cells expressing wt and mutant miR-372&3, the cluster and the controls p53kd and empty vector. Both in the absence of RASV12 and in its presence, a significant reduction in LATS2 protein level was observed upon miR-372&3 expression (Figure 5B). Using quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis, we observed a 2-fold effect on LATS2 RNA levels and 4- to 5-fold on protein levels by the miR-371-3 cluster (Figure 5C). As a control, we used a LATS2 knockdown construct (Figure 5F). These results show that a combined effect of RNA destruction and translation inhibition is used by miR-372&3 to silence LATS2.
2084 miR-372/3 was predicted to bind two sites in the 3′UTR of LATS2 that are highly conserved between human, mouse, and zebrafish (Figure 5D). To further substantiate LATS2 as a direct target of miR372&3, we cloned its 3′UTR downstream of the firefly luciferase gene (pGL3-LATS2). We transfected either pGL3-LATS2 or the controls pGL3-372 and pGL3-373 (containing a miR-complementary sequence in their 3′UTR) or pGL3 into Tera1 and MCF-7 cells (respectively positive and negative for miR-371-3) ( Figures 4D and S6). As predicted, the 372/373 complementary sequences mediated strong inhibition of luciferase expression in Tera1 cells. Significantly, a potent inhibition of luciferase activity was also mediated by the 3′UTR of LATS2 in either MCF-7 ectopically expressing miR-372 or in Tera1 cells but not by a construct mutated at both miR-372-predicted target sites. These results indicate that LATS2 is indeed a direct target of miR-372&3.
2085 Next, we tested whether LATS2 is a functional target of miR-372&3 using a YFP-competition assay. Indeed, inhibition of LATS2 conferred a growth advantage to cells expressing RASV12 (Figure 5F). The overall effect was less than the effect of the miR-Vec 373 but comparable to loss of p53. Therefore, these results point to LATS2 as a mediator of the miR-372 and miR-373 effects on cell proliferation and tumorigenicity, although they do not exclude the participation of other direct miR-targets, such as Suv39-H1, in these processes. Further investigation should elucidate the exact role of LATS2 downregulation and the possible participation of other miR-372&3-targets in the overall observed miR effect on cellular transformation.
2086 Discussion
2087 Functional Genetic Screens for miRNAs
2088 We developed a miRNA-expression vector library and a corresponding barcode array to detect miRNAs whose expression modifies a defined cellular pathway. We demonstrate here the power of this technology by the identification of miRNA-372 and miRNA-373 as potential oncogenes that collaborate with oncogenic RAS in cellular transformation (Figure 5G). However, this strategy is also suitable for the identification of miRNAs that regulate other cellular pathways resulting in a proliferation or survival difference, such as the DNA damage response, differentiation, sensitivity to growth factors, and resistance to anticancer drugs. Furthermore, the miR-Lib tool can be used in a single-well format to identify growth-independent phenotypes.
2089 Collaboration of miRNA372&3 and RASV12 in Tumorigenesis
2090 Sustained proliferation of cells in the presence of oncogenic signals is a major leap toward tumorigenicity (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000). We found miR-372&3 to collaborate with RASV12 and stimulate a full-blown neoplastic transformation phenotype. However, whereas in the majority of the cases neoplastic transformation will require inactivation of p53 (for example by expression of HPV E6, HDM2, or mutant p53), miR372&3 uniquely allowed transformation to occur while p53 was active. This indicates that miRNA-372&3 do not block RASV12 signals but rather allow cells to proliferate irrespective of p53 activation and induction of p21cip1.
2091 The expression of miR-372&3 results in prevention of the CDK inhibition that is caused by the oncogenic stress response. In both primary human fibroblasts and in a TGCT-derived cell line, cells expressing miR-372&3 were insensitive to elevated levels of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21cip1. Although the exact mechanism responsible for this effect is still unclear, we suggest that suppression of LATS2 is an important factor. Indeed, the expression of LATS2 is directly controlled by miR-372&3, and its activity is important for RASV12-induced senescence. However, further investigation is required to demonstrate the exact mechanism of LATS2 action and whether there are other targets of miR-372&3, such as Suv39H1, that are relevant to this phenotype.
2092 Correlations to Other miRNAs
2093 Based on the seed sequence, the miR-372&3 gene family also includes miR-93 and miR-302a-e. As these may share a broad range of target genes, they may also share many functions. Indeed, preliminary results show that similar to miR-372&3, albeit with minor differences, both miR-93 and miR-302a-e can effectively target the LATS2 3′UTR and bypass oncogene-induced senescence (manuscript in preparation).
2094 Role of miR372&3 in TGCT Development
2095 Our results suggest that during transformation, the activities of miR-372&3 circumvented the need to mutate p53, leading to a DNA-damage-sensitive transformed phenotype. These characteristics of miR-372&3-transformed primary human cells therefore suggest a role in wt p53-tumor genotypes that are also sensitive to chemotherapies, including irradiation. Indeed, TGCTs conform to this profile (Masters and Koberle, 2003). This could for instance be a result of high mdm2 levels, as was previously suggested for mouse teratocarcinomas (Lutzker and Levine, 1996). However, by several criteria mouse teratocarcinomas are counterparts of human germ cell tumors of neonates and infants rather than TGCT (Oosterhuis and Looijenga, 2005). Indeed, while the first show high mdm2 expression levels, this was not demonstrated in TGCT (Mostert et al., 2000). Therefore, it is highly significant that we found that miR-372&3-expressing TGCTs did not contain mutated p53 alleles, whereas a subset of miR-371-3 negative primary TGCTs and cell lines did. Altogether, these provide a strong indication that there is no selective advantage to mutate p53 during TGCT development when the miR-371-3 cluster is expressed.
2096 The potent role of miR-372&3 in cellular transformation and potentially in TGCT development raises the possibility that they may play a similar role in somatic tumors. To this end, we determined the expression of the miR-371-3 cluster in several distinct somatic tumor cell lines and found little evidence for their expression (Figure S6). Consistent with our results, clear miR-371-3 cluster expression was observed in only 1 out of 70 leukemia tumors examined by others (Lu et al., 2005). It therefore seems that miR-372&3 expression is a rare event in somatic tumors. Whether such a role can be seen with the other members of the miR-372/3 family remains an open possibility.
2097 Although both miR-372&3 and miR-302a-e clusters are expressed in ES cells (Suh et al., 2004), the miRNA-302 cluster is not expressed in many of these primary seminomas and nonseminomas (Figure S7). It is therefore most likely that the expression of miR-371-3 in primary TGCT is not merely a remnant of their ES cell phenotype but rather a selective event during TGCT tumorigenesis.
2098 Function of miRNA372&3 in Embryonic Stem Cells
2099 Our results suggest a link between the expression of miR-372&3 in embryonic stem cells and their function in cellular proliferation in these cells. miR-372&3 may facilitate rapid growth of stem cells by suppressing the expression of CDK inhibitors. Intriguingly, Drosophila germ cells and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells require miRNAs to proliferate ( Forstemann et al., 2005 and Hatfield et al., 2005). The proliferation defect in Drosophila mutants that lack miRNAs could be alleviated by loss of dacapo, the Drosophila p21cip1 homolog ( Forstemann et al., 2005 and Hatfield et al., 2005).
2100 Our results indicate that due to enhanced tolerance to oncogenic mutations, deregulated expression of miR-372&3 predisposes cells for accumulation of carcinogenic events. Thus, the expression of these miRNAs must be carefully controlled during differentiation to prevent progression to cancer. Which factors control miR-371-3 expression during differentiation and whether their activity is causally related to development of TGCTs remain to be explored. Nevertheless, our experiments stress the importance of a strong downregulation of factors that maintain rapid cell proliferation, as in the absence of this downregulation safeguard mechanisms against oncogene emergence are functionally impaired.
2101 Experimental Procedures
2102 Constructs
2103 pMSCV-Blast and pMSCV-YFP were made by replacing the puromycin resistance marker of pMSCV-puro (Clontech) with a PCR product encoding the blasticidin resistance gene from cDNA6/TR (invitrogen) or YFP from pEYFP-N1 (Clontech), respectively. pRetrosuper (pRS)-Blast was generated by replacing the 3′LTR from pMSCV-Blast with the 3′LTR from pRS-Hyg (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003).
2104 miR-Vec-Ctrl was made by deleting the MCS and the PGK-promoter from pMSCV-Blast, followed by insertion of the CMV promoter from pcDNA-3.1+ and a stuffer DNA derived from the first 211 nt of hTR downstream of the resistance marker. miR-Vec-YFP was cloned similar to miR-Vec-Ctrl, only starting from pMSCV-YFP. pBabe-puro-RasV12 and pBabe-puro, pMSCV-GFP-st, pRS-GFP, pBabe-H2B-GFP, pCMV-Cyclin E, pCMV-CDK2, and pBabe-RasV12ERTAM were described before (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003 and De Vita et al., 2005). p53kd, p16kd, p14ARFkd, p21cip1kd shRNA constructs were described before (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003 and Duursma and Agami, 2005). pMSCV-Blast RASV12-ERTAM was made by subcloning RASV12-ERTAM into pMSCV-Blast. p21-RFP was produced by cloning p21 to the N terminus of dsRFP. The constructs encoding Luciferase-3′-G6PD wt and mut were a kind gift of David Bartel (Lewis et al., 2003).
2105 The miRNA minigenes were PCR amplified from genomic human DNA, cloned downstream of the CMV promoter in miR-Vec, and sequence verified. The primers used for the genomic PCR amplification of the individual miRNA minigenes, the miR-Vec-cluster and the miR-Vec mutants, are listed in Figure S3.
2106 LATS2 knockdown constructs were cloned to pRETROSUPER (pRS)-YFP (Brummelkamp et al., 2002). Targeting sequences are shown in Figure S3.
2107 miR-Array
2108 Genomic DNA was isolated from BJ/EHT cells with the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The inserts were recovered by PCR using primers listed in Figure S3. The PCR product was purified, and 500 ng was labeled using ULS-Cy3 or Cy5 (Kreatech) and hybridized to the miR-Array according to the manufacturers instructions (http://microarrays.nki.nl). As the amount of spots was too small to normalize automatically, the red and green signals were normalized by hand in Excel. For each spot, the log 2 of the red and green ratio as well as the log 2 of the square root of the product of the two signals were calculated. Outliers were picked and listed and compared across three independent experiments.
2109 miRNA Detection
2110 RNase Protection assays were performed using the mirVana miRNA probe construction and detection kits (Ambion) according to the manufacturers instructions. 2.5 -10 ug of RNA was used per reaction. Primers to make the RPA probes are listed in Figure S3. The antisense cyclophilin probe contained nucleotides 46–149 of Accession # BC013915.
2111 In situ hybridizations were performed with a mix of LNA oligos against miR-372 and miR-373 (Exiqon) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2112 Cell Culture and Antibodies
2113 Primary BJ fibroblasts with an ecotropic receptor Neo and pBabe-puro-hTert (BJ-ET) (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003) or pBabe-H2BGFP-hTert (BJ-EHT) (Kolfschoten et al., 2005) were grown in DMEM plus 10% FCS and antibiotics. NCCIT cells were grown in RPMI plus 10% FCS and antibiotics.
2114 Retrovirus was made by calcium-phosphate transduction of EcoPack 2 (Clontech) and harvesting 40 and 64 hr later. BJ cells were selected with the relevant selective medium 48 hr after transduction for at least a week. In the case of RASV12-encoding retroviruses, the selection was continued for the entire duration of the experiment.
2115 Antibodies used were DO-1 (p53), F5 (p21cip1), F235 (RAS), M20 (cyclin E), M2 (CDK2) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and 3D10 (LATS2) (Toji et al., 2004). Western blots were scanned and quantified using AIDA software (Raytek, Sheffield, UK).
2116 Genetic Screen
2117 BJ-EHT cells were transduced with a mixture of 197 miR-Vec vectors, drug selected for a week, and transduced independently three times with pBabe-puro-RASV12 or pBabe-puro. Cells from the independent transductions were propagated for 2 or 3 weeks before genomic DNA was isolated.
2118 Growth Assay
2119 BJ-EHT cells were transduced with miR-Vec or pRS-blast constructs, drug selected for a week, transduced with pBabe-Puro-RASV12, and drug selected for 3 days. 3 × 105 cells were plated in triplicates in 6 cm dishes and propagated twice a week. SA-β-galactosidase activity was assessed 10 days after RASV12 transduction, as described (Kolfschoten et al., 2005). 3 × 200 cells were scored for β-galactosides activity.
2120 Soft Agar Assay and Tumorigenic Growth in Mice
2121 BJ-EHT cells were transduced to more than 80% with pMSCV-GFP-st, pRS-Hyg-p16kd, drug selected, transduced with the various miR-Vec retroviruses or pRS-Blast-p53kd, drug selected again, and transduced with pBabe-puro-RASV12. After a week, the cells were either plated in triplicates in soft agar and macroscopically visible colonies were counted after 3 weeks or 106 cells were injected subcutaneously to athymic nude mice.
2122 Cumulative Growth Advantage Assay
2123 BJ/ET cells were transduced with pMSCV-Blast-RASV12-ERTAM, drug selected, and transduced with miR-Vec–YFP or pRS-GFP constructs. Efficiency of transduction (starting at 20%–60%) was assessed by FACS in FL1, and cells were plated with and without 10−7 M 4-OHT-Tamoxifen. Cells were propagated, and the percentage of positive cells was measured twice a week. The relative growth advantage was calculated as described (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003).
2124 IP-Kinase Assay and Flow Cytometry
2125 IP-kinase assay and flowcytometry were performed as described in (Agami and Bernards, 2000).
2126 Expression Array Analysis and Target Prediction
2127 Total RNA from BJ-EHT-st-p16kd-RASV12 cells either expressing a p53kd shRNA or the miR-Vec-cluster was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and hybridized to an oligo microarray using a standard protocol (http://microarrays.nki.nl). The genes that decreased 2-fold or more were further screened for possible miR-372/3 target sites using a local version of the TargetScan algorithm (Lewis et al., 2003) with default parameters (http://www.mekentosj.com/targetscanner).
